\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
In many Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), problem instances exhibit clearly defined internal structures that can be expressed as graphs. Here, a graph is a tuple $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and the set of edges $E \subseteq V \times V$ defines the relationships among vertices. While there are other methods to deal with inputs of variable size (Fully Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are Neural Networks tailored specifically to learn from structured input in the form of graphs, making them a valuable tool for Machine Learning (ML) tasks on data with graph-like structure.   

In recent years, GNNs have gained popularity in their application in the context of COPs. However, current end-to-end ML approaches are in most cases not competitive to state-of-the-art (meta-)heuristic solution approaches, and their application is limited to small instances, where exact algorithms are available. Nonetheless, GNNs show promise in their use in COPs, and there have been many successful applications over the last years, e.g. 
% \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, or
\cite{Oberweger2022}, where a Large Neighborhood Search is enhanced by a GNN that guides a destroy-operator, or \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, producing solutions that reach a solution quality of $99.5\%$ while being three orders of magnitude faster. 

The main motivation of this thesis is to further study the application of GNNs in the context of metaheuristics for COPs defined on graphs. We address the problems of current end-to-end approaches by using a GNN only as a component of a metaheuristic search procedure that should enhance the search for high quality solutions either by speeding up the search or by improving the quality of its final solutions. More specifically, we consider several relaxations of a COP defined on graphs, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP), that seem to be well-suited for our purpose. 

\section{Considered Problems}
The MCP is the problem of finding a fully connected subgraph - a \textit{clique} - of maximum size in a given graph. It is a fundamental problem in computer science, as its decision variant is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems \cite{Karp1972}. The MCP has several practical applications, e.g. in bioinformatics \cite{Dognin2010} and social network analysis \cite{Pattillo_network_analysis_2013}. However, for some real-world applications that require identifying dense subgraphs, the MCP is too strict a model. This leads to the introduction of several clique relaxations such as - among others - the Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) (introduced in \cite{Abello2002}, Definition \ref{def:mqcp}), the Maximum $k$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) (introduced in \cite{Yu2006}, Definition \ref{def:mdcp}), and the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (MPP) (introduced in \cite{Seidman1978}, Definition \ref{def:mpp}). 
As all of these problems are NP-hard optimization problems, it is practically often infeasible to obtain exact solutions for large instances. However, many real-world applications often require solutions for large graphs. Therefore, efficient heuristic methods are needed that produce high quality solutions in an acceptable amount of time. While the MCP has been studied well over the last decades, heuristic methods for MQCP, MDCP, and MPP are less abundant. It is therefore another motivation of this thesis to enrich the arsenal of heuristic methods for these relaxations of the MCP. 

\section{Outline of the Thesis}

\chapter{Relaxations of the Maximum Clique Problem}

\section{Notation}

Throughout this thesis, we use standard graph theory notation. 
We consider $G = (V, E)$ to be a graph with node or vertex set $V$ and edge set $E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V\}$. We use the terms node, nodes and vertex, vertices interchangeably when denoting elements of $V$. 
A graph $G$ is \emph{simple}, if it contains no self-loops (e.g. $\{v,v\} \in E$) or multiple edges between two vertices. In this thesis, we only consider unweighted, undirected, simple graphs, as all the considered problems are defined on such graphs. 
A graph $G' = (V', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (V,E)$ iff $V' \subseteq V$, $E' \subseteq E$, and $\{u,v\} \in E' \colon u,v \in V'$. Let $S \subseteq V$ be a set of vertices in $G$. The subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$, denoted as $G[S]$, is a graph with vertex set $S$ and edge set $E(S) = \{ \{u,v\} \mid \{u,v\} \in E, u,v \in S \}$. 
A \emph{clique} is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $G[S]$ is fully connected, i.e. $|E(S)| = \frac{|S| \cdot (|S|-1)}{2}$. A fully connected graph on $n$ nodes is denoted as $K_n$.
The density $dens(G)$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as the ratio of the number of edges $|E|$ to the number of edges in a fully-connected graph with $|V|$ nodes $\binom{|V|}{2}$. The density of a graph is therefore a rational number between zero and one. 


\section{The Maximum Clique Problem}

The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP, Definition \ref{def:mcp}) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science. Its decision variant was one of first problems that were shown to be NP-Complete \cite{Karp1972}, from which NP-hardness can be derived for the maximization variant. The MCP is a well-studied problem and has many real-world applications, e.g. in social network analysis, bioinformatics, and telecommunication \todo{include citations}. 
Figure \ref{fig:maxclique} depicts a maximum clique in a graph. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{graphics/graph1-clique.eps}
    \caption{A maximum clique.}
    \label{fig:maxclique}
\end{figure}
For some real-world applications however, the MCP is too strict a model, as some applications require identifying large, dense subgraphs, but not necessarily fully connected subgraphs. This leads to the introduction of several relaxations of the maximum clique problem. \todo{list relevant relaxations}

\begin{definition}[Maximum Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is the problem of finding clique of maximum size in $G$. 
\end{definition}

\section{The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem}

\begin{definition}[Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mqcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1]$, the Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has an edge density of at least $\gamma$, or, in other words, $G[S]$ contains at least $\gamma \binom{|S|}{2}$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MQCP}


\subsection{Preprocessing of MQCP Instances}

In \cite{Abello2002}, the authors introduce the notion of $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices in the context of preprocessing. A vertex $v$ is $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} if $v$ and all its neighbors have degree smaller than $\gamma k$. If a lower bound $k$ for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique is known, the authors propose to remove all edges incident to $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices from $G$ in preprocessing. This preprocessing rule might be used to speed up the search process by sparsifying the graph, but we note that this preprocessing rule does not preserve the existence of optimal solutions. We prove this claim by giving a counterexample in Figure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}, where the optimal solution cannot be obtained after applying said preprocessing rule.

      \label{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Consider the given graph $G$ given in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub1}. The considered MQCP instance is defined by $G$ and $\gamma=0.5$ consisting of a $K_3$ and a $K_7$ connected by an edge. Since $G$ has a density $dens(G) = \frac{25}{45} \approx 0.56$, the maximum $0.5$-quasi clique in $G$ is $V$. Assume a lower bound of $k=6$ is known, therefore the two nodes on the left are $k\gamma$\emph{-peelable} and preprocessing would remove all edges incident to these vertices, as can be seen in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub2}. Therefore, the density of this preprocessed graph would be reduced to $\frac{22}{45} \approx 0.49$ and the optimal solution $V$ would not be preserved.}

\begin{definition}[Maximum $k$-defective-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mdcp}
	Given a graph \\ 
    $G = (V,E)$ and integer $k$, the Maximum $k$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains at least $\binom{|S|}{2} - k$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\section{The Maximum k-plex Problem}

	such that each $v \in S$ is adjacent to at least $|S| - k$ vertices in $S$.

\section{Solution Approaches for the MQCP}
\subsection{Exact Approaches}\label{milp-mqcp}
Pattillo et al. \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013} propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation with a number of variables quadratic in the size of the vertex set $V$. 
It is derived from the following quadratic formulation, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ are binary decision variables representing the solution set $S \subseteq V$, and $a_{ij}$ represent elements of the adjacency matrix with $a_{ij}$ equal to one if $\{i,j\} \in E$ and zero otherwise: 
\begin{align}
    \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i & \\
    \text{s.t. } \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j & \geq \gamma \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n x_i x_j
\end{align}
The authors linearize the above quadratic formulation by introducing variables $w_{ij}$ defined as $w_{ij} = x_i x_j$: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n (\gamma - a_{ij}) w_{ij} \leq 0  
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & &

\chapter{Local Search with Graph Neural Networks}

In this chapter we present the main contribution of this thesis in detail: a local search algorithm using Graph Neural Networks. 
At first, we introduce the general structure of the algorithm without using GNNs in Section \ref{sec:algorithm-structure}. Section presents two types of construction heuristics we use in our algorithm. The first one is used to efficiently obtain a feasible initial solution of high quality that can be used as a lower bound, whereas the second one does not necessarily yield feasible solutions, but is used to explore new regions of the search space not yet visited. In Section \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} we define the main move operator used in the local search procedure and define the corresponding neighborhood structures. Furthermore, we show in detail the local search procedure of our algorithm that utilizes said neighborhood structures. Section \ref{sec:gnn-local-search} presents our idea of utilizing a GNN to the previously described local search algorithm. In Section \ref{sec:gnn-training} we show how training data is generated and how target values are obtained. Finally, our proposed GNN architecture is presented in \ref{sec:gnn-architecture}.

\section{Algorithm Structure} \label{sec:algorithm-structure}

The pseudocode of the general structure of the local search algorithm is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure}.
$InitialSolution$ constructs a feasible initial solution. Its main purpose is to obtain a high quality lower bound to obtain a good starting value for $k$. The procedure is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:construction-heuristics}. In line \ref{alg:structure-freq} a long-term memory $Freq$ is initialized, where $Freq[i]$ stores how many times each node is operated on for $i=1,\dots,n$. This memory is kept when the loop in line \ref{alg:structure-while-start}-\ref{alg:structure-while-end} is repeated, but no feasible solution could be found. In $ConstructionHeuristic$, $Freq$ is used to produce a candidate solution that favors nodes that have not been considered yet. This way, new regions of the search space are explored. The candidate solution obtained in line \ref{alg:structure-construction} is then improved by the local search procedure, which is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} along with the definition of neighborhood structures. If the resulting solution $S$ is feasible, a simple search is performed in $Extend$ to check if the solution can be extended to a feasible solution of greater size as shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:extend}.
Furthermore, $k$ is increased, $Freq$ is reset, and the best-so-far found solution $S^*$ is updated. 
If the solution obtained by the local search procedure is not feasible, the while-loop is repeated until the stop criterion is met, e.g. the time limit is reached.

\section{Construction Heuristics}\label{sec:construction-heuristics}

We propose two different construction heuristics. The first one is based on Beam Search and returns a feasible solution that can be used as a lower bound for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in the input graph. The pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:initial-construction}. We use a simple data structure for nodes of the beam search tree with fields $node.S$ containing a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique that this node corresponds to, and $node.g$, which is the value of the node according to the used guidance function. The root node of the beam search tree is defined by an empty candidate set. The main loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}-\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end} expands all nodes in the current beam into all feasible successor nodes. Since a node represents a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, successor nodes are generated by checking for all $u \in V \setminus node.S$ whether $node.S \cup \{u\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique. These successor nodes are then added to a list $children$. All nodes in $children$ are evaluated by a guidance function $g$, and the $\beta$ nodes with highest $g$-values form a new beam while the remaining nodes are discarded. Since all the solutions corresponding to nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, a random node is selected to update the best-so-far solution $S^*$ on each level. Finally, the maximum cardinality solution is returned. 

We propose to different guidance functions for this beam search construction heuristic: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first one returns the solution size that is obtained by a simple greedy construction: Given a node with candidate set $S$, greedily add the node $v = \arg \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$ if $S \cup \{v\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, where $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. Ties are broken randomly. The size of the solution obtained this way is then the return value of the guidance function. This guidance function has a time complexity of $O(kn)$ per iteration, where $k$ is the solution size obtained by the greedy construction and $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. 
    \item The second guidance function evaluates a node with candidate set $S$ by calculating the sum of the $d$ nodes in $V \setminus S$ with the highest values for $d_S(u)$. This guidance function is designed to be more efficient than the previous one. 
\end{itemize}


\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwIn{Graph $G$, Target density $\gamma$, guidance function $g$, beam width $\beta$}
    \KwOut{A feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique $S$}
    $root.S \gets \emptyset$ \;
    $S^* \gets \emptyset$ \;
    $beam \gets \{root\}$ \;
    \While{$beam$ not empty}{\label{alg:initial-construction-while-start}
        $children \gets \emptyset$ \;
        \For{$node \in beam$}{
            Expand $node.S$ into all feasible solutions that can be obtained by adding a node from $V \setminus node.S$ \;
            $children \gets $ add feasible solutions obtained from $node$ \;
        }
        \If{$children$ not empty}{
            $S^* \gets node.S$ for some arbitrary node in $children$ 
        }
        Evaluate nodes in $children$ by guidance function $g$ \;
        $beam \gets $ Choose $\beta$ nodes with highest $g$-values
    }\label{alg:initial-construction-while-end}
    \Return{$S^*$}
    \caption{Construction Heuristic based on Beam Search}
    \label{alg:initial-construction}
\end{algorithm}

The second construction heuristic has a different goal: It aims to return a set of nodes $S$ of fixed size $|S| = k$ that leads to new local optima when used as a starting point for the local search procedure. The candidate solution returned by this construction heuristic is therefore not necessarily feasible. 
It is based on a GRASP approach, but includes a parameter $p \in \{0,1\}$ which controls the balance between choosing nodes that have not been explored yet and nodes that increase the objective value of the current candidate solution. This approach of balancing exploration and objective value is inspired by \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, where the authors use a similar strategy during construction. We combine this idea with using a GRASP-like approach. The procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:exploration-construction}. At first, a starting node is selected by choosing a node with the lowest $Freq$-value, breaking ties randomly. In each iteration of the main while loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}-\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end}, with probability $p$ a node with the lowest $Freq$-value in $N_G(S)$ is added to the current candidate solution $S$. If $N_G(S)$ is empty, an arbitrary node with the lowest $Freq$ value from $V\setminus S$ is selected instead. With probability $1-p$ we perform an iteration of a GRASP-like construction: The restricted candidate list $RCL$ is built by adding all nodes from $V \setminus S$ that fulfill the condition $d_S(u) \geq d_{\max} - \alpha(d_{\max} - d_{\min})$, where $d_S(u)$ denotes the number of neighbors in $S$ for a node $u \in V \setminus S$, and $d_{\max}, d_{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum values for $d_S(u)$ for nodes in $V \setminus S$. Here, the parameter $\alpha$ controls the balance between greediness and randomness in a GRASP-like manner: $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a greedy strategy, whereas $\alpha=1$ corresponds to a purely random strategy.

\section{Neighborhood Structure and Local Search} \label{sec:neighborhood-structure}

The neighborhood of a candidate solution $S$ is defined by a move operator that swaps a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$. The set of neighboring candidate solutions of $S$ with $|S| = k$ that can be obtained by a single swap move is therefore defined as $\Omega_1 = \{ S \setminus \{u\} \cup \{v\} \mid u \in S, v \in V \setminus S \}$ and has size $|\Omega_1| = k \cdot (|V|-k)$, which is in $O(|V|^2)$. Similarly, we define $\Omega_d$ for $d=1,2,3,\dots$ as the set of neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping $d$ nodes from $S$ with $d$ nodes from $V \setminus S$, obtaining a neighborhood of size $|\Omega_d| = \binom{k}{d} \cdot \binom{|V|-k}{d}$, which is in $O(|V|^{2d})$. 


The quality of a candidate solution is dependent of the considered problem. For the MQCP and the MDCP a candidate solution $S$ is of higher quality than a neighboring solution $S^\prime$ if $G[S]$ contains more edges than $G[S']$. Thus, we define the objective function $f \colon 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ for the local search for MQCP and MDCP as the function that maps a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ to the number of edges in the induced subgraph $G[S]$. Therefore, $S$ is better than $S^\prime$ if and only if $f(S) > f(S^\prime)$. 

Similar algorithms that use local search in order to improve a candidate solution (e.g. \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}) only search the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for improving solutions. As the size of this neighborhood is already quadratic in $|V|$, the authors of the mentioned algorithms restrict the neighborhood to promising moves. A scoring function is used to find promising nodes in $V \setminus S$ and in $S$ that can be used for swaps. This scoring function is in most cases defined as $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. This way, the increase (or decrease) in the objective function by swapping a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$ can simply be calculated by $\Delta_{uv} = d_S(v) - d_S(u) - e_{uv}$, where $e_{uv} = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E$ and $e_{uv} = 0$ otherwise. 
The scoring function $d_S$ is thus used to restrict the neighborhood $\Omega_1$. 
Let $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u)$ and $d_{\max} = \max_{v \in V \setminus S} d_S(v)$. Furthermore, let $X = \{ u \mid u \in S, d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}$ and $Y = \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \}$. The neighborhood $\Omega_1$ of a candidate solution $S$ is then restricted to only those neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping a node $u \in X$ with a node $v \in Y$, as all node swaps that maximize $\Delta_{uv}$ are contained in this restricted neighborhood. 

The pseudocode for our local search procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:local-search-procedure}. 
In each iteration of the main while-loop the restricted candidate sets $X$ and $Y$ are created from the sets $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively. These sets are created as described before, with an additional restriction: To prevent cycling through the same candidate solutions over and over again, a short-term memory is used to further restrict the sets $X$ and $Y$. There are two main methods that can be found in the literature, which we want to evaluate in our algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a tabu list is used to prevent cycling. Each time a vertex is in or out of the solution, it is added to the tabu list for a fixed number of iterations. While a vertex is in the tabu list, it is blocked and cannot be used in swaps. In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, the authors use two tabu lists: One for moving vertices out of the candidate solution, and one for adding vertices to the candidate solution. In \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a single tabu list is used for both operations. 
    \item In \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, the authors use Configuration Checking. In its simplest form, once a vertex $v$ is moved out of the candidate Solution, it is blocked from being moved again until at least one neighbor of $v$ is moved. The authors refine this strategy by using a threshold for each node $v$ that starts with $threshold(v) = 1$ for all $v \in V$. Each time a vertex $v$ is moved into the candidate solution, $threshold(v)$ is increased by 1. When $v$ is moved out of the candidate solution, it is blocked from being moved again, until $threshold(v)$ of its neighbors have been moved. Additionally, if $threshold(v) > ub\_threshold$, where $ub\_threshold$ is a user-defined upper bound, then $threshold(v)$ is reset to 1. 
\end{itemize}
If no improving move is possible, or one of the sets $X, Y$ is empty, a swap of two random unblocked vertices is performed in order to diversify the current local optimum. Furthermore, we define stop criteria: If the best solution $S^*$ does not improve for a fixed amount of iterations $it$, the procedure is stopped and $S^*$ is returned. Additionally, if the time limit is reached, the procedure is stopped as well.

\section{Training the GNN}\label{sec:gnn-training}

In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, we need to be able to identify the best neighboring solutions in a given neighborhood relative to a candidate solution $S$. 

\subsection{MQCP and MDCP}

To identify the best neighboring solution for a candidate solution $S$ in the neighborhood $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$, we propose two different methods. First, we propose a MILP formulation that is suited for small instances. It is based on the formulation in \ref{milp-mqcp}, but we change it to find the neighboring solution $S'$ that can be obtained after at most $d$ swaps and maximizes the amount of edges in $G[S']$: 
\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} w_{ij} \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i \in V} x_i = k \\
     & \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq k - d    
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & & 
\end{align}

Additionally, we propose a second method that approximates the best neighboring solution, trading solution quality with efficiency in order to make training possible on larger instances. This method is based on Beam Search and its pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:lookahead-beam-search}. We define a simple data structure for nodes in the beam search tree, where each node corresponds to a set $S'$ that can be obtained from the candidate solution $S$ by swapping the nodes in $node.in \subseteq S$ with the nodes in $node.out \subseteq V\setminus S$. Furthermore, $node.f$ denotes the objective value of a node, which is defined as the number of edges in the subgraph induced by $S'$. In each iteration all nodes representing candidate solutions in the beam are expanded into child nodes the following way: Assume a candidate solution $S'$ corresponds to a node in the search tree. This candidate solution is then expanded into up to $\alpha^2$ candidate solutions that can be obtained by switching the $\alpha$ nodes with highest $d_{S'}$-values in $V \setminus S'$ with the nodes with the lowest $d_{S'}$ values in $S'$. All expanded nodes are then evaluated by their objective value and the best $\beta$ candidate solutions become the new beam, whereas the remaining solutions are discarded.

        $d \gets d-1$ \;
        $children \gets \emptyset$\;
        \For{$node \in beam$}{
            $S' \gets $ solution corresponding to $node$ \;
            $A \gets $ select $\alpha$ vertices in $S'$ with lowest $d_{S'}$-values \;
            $B \gets $ select $\alpha$ vertices in $V \setminus {S'}$ with highest $d_{S'}$-values \;
            \For{$(u,v) \in A \times B$}{
                Create node for solution defined by $S' \setminus \{u\} \cup \{v\}$ and add it to $children$
            }
        }
