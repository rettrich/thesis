\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis investigates the utilization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the context of a local search based metaheuristic for solving edge-based relaxations of a well-known combinatorial optimization problem (COP), the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP).
The motivation of this work is presented in Section \ref{sec:motivation}, as well as the relevance and applications of the considered problems. A brief overview of the contributions of this work is provided in Section \ref{sec:methodology}. Lastly, we outline the structure of this thesis in Section \ref{sec:outline}.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
In many COPs, problem instances exhibit clearly defined internal structures that can be expressed as graphs. Here, a graph is a tuple $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and the set of edges $E \subseteq V \times V$ defines the relationships among vertices. While there are other methods to deal with inputs of variable size (Fully Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are Neural Networks tailored specifically to learn from structured input in the form of graphs, making them a valuable tool for Machine Learning (ML) tasks on data with graph-like structure.   

In recent years, GNNs have gained popularity in their application in the context of COPs. However, current end-to-end ML approaches are in most cases not competitive to state-of-the-art (meta-)heuristic solution approaches, and their application is limited to small instances, where effective exact algorithms are available. Nonetheless, GNNs show promise in their use in COPs, and there have been many successful applications over the last years, e.g. 
% \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, or
\cite{Oberweger2022}, where a Large Neighborhood Search is enhanced by a GNN that guides a destroy-operator, or \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal independent sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, producing solutions that reach a solution quality of $99.5\%$ while being three orders of magnitude faster. 

The main motivation of this thesis is to further study the application of GNNs in the context of metaheuristics for COPs defined on graphs. We address the problems of current end-to-end approaches by using a GNN only as a component of a metaheuristic search procedure that shall provide additional heuristic guidance. More specifically, we consider relaxations of a well-studied COP, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). 

The MCP is the problem of finding a fully connected subgraph -- a \textit{clique} -- of maximum size in a given graph. It is a fundamental problem in computer science, as its decision variant is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems \cite{Karp1972}. The MCP has several practical applications, e.g.,  in bioinformatics \cite{Dognin2010} and social network analysis \cite{Pattillo_network_analysis_2013}. However, for some real-world applications that require identifying dense subgraphs, the MCP is too strict a model. This leads to the introduction of several clique relaxations such as -- among others -- the Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) (introduced in \cite{Abello2002}, Definition \ref{def:mqcp}), and the Maximum $k$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) (introduced in \cite{Yu2006}, Definition \ref{def:mdcp}). 

As all of these problems are NP-hard optimization problems, it is practically often infeasible to obtain exact solutions for large instances. However, many real-world applications often require solutions for large graphs. Therefore, efficient heuristic methods are needed that produce high quality solutions in an acceptable amount of time. While the MCP has been studied extensively over the last decades, heuristic methods for the MQCP and the MDCP are less abundant. It is therefore another motivation of this thesis to enrich the arsenal of heuristic methods for these relaxations of the MCP and to provide a foundation for future research including the application of GNNs in the context of MCP relaxations. 

\section{Methodological Approach}\label{sec:methodology}
The goal of this thesis is to build upon well-established metaheuristic approaches for MCP relaxations and evaluate, how and where GNNs can be utilized in the context of such algorithms in order to provide additional information. 
Studying the relevant literature (e.g., \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, \cite{peng_solving_2021}), we found that the most effective metaheuristic approaches for MCP relaxations are based on metaheuristics centered around local search, where neighboring solutions can be reached by swapping a vertex inside the current candidate solution with a vertex outside the candidate solution. In order to evaluate efficiently which vertices seem promising for swapping, a scoring function is used that assigns scores to the vertices in the graph in each iteration of the local search. Using these scores, the neighborhood can be restricted to only promising vertices. 
Building upon these approaches, we aim at utilizing a GNN to extract structural information from input graphs that can be used to enhance such a scoring function. 
One of the main contributions of this thesis is therefore the algorithmic design of a local search based metaheuristic named LSBM, that can use a GNN-based scoring function. 

As the considered MCP relaxations are defined on non-attributed graphs, one of the goals of this thesis is to evaluate, which feature initialization methods can be used to effectively extract information from input graphs. Thus, we investigate several centrality-based and learning-based methods within the context of our proposed algorithm that can be found in the literature. 

Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that is used to generate training data in order to train the GNN to make high quality predictions. A training sample consists of the input graph, a candidate solution, and target values obtained by a look-ahead search that searches a neighborhood structure for a neighboring solution with a higher objective value. Using this data, the GNN is trained to predict, which vertices are likely to be in a swap that leads to an improved solution. In order to compute target labels for the vertices in the input graph, we present different methods to search neighborhood structures relative to the candidate solution in a training sample. 

Finally, we conduct computational experiments in order to evaluate our approach on graphs of different sizes and densities and discuss future work that can be done in order to improve our method. 

\section{Outline of the Thesis}\label{sec:outline}
Firstly, we define the notation of graph-related terms used throughout this thesis and show formal definitions of the considered problems in Chapter \ref{chp:problems-definitions}. 
Afterwards, we review and discuss related work and methodology, namely GNNs, node representation learning, the use of ML in combinatorial optimization, and the state-of-the-art for both exact and heuristic solution approaches for the considered MCP relaxations in Chapter \ref{chp:related-work}. 
Then, in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} we propose our algorithm LSBM and its components in detail. The main contribution of our work is contained in Chapter \ref{chp:gnn}, as we present, how a GNN can be incorporated into the previously presented LSBM and how it can be trained using our training algorithm LSBM-T. Thereafter, we show the results of computational experiments and the evaluation of our proposed methods in Chapter \ref{chp:evaluation}. Finally, we summarize our findings, offer concluding remarks, and outline promising future work in Chapter \ref{chp:conclusions}. 

\chapter{Considered Problems and Definitions}\label{chp:problems-definitions}

In this chapter we provide all necessary definitions and notations used throughout this thesis. We list commonly used graph theoretic notations and defintions in Section \ref{sec:notation}. Afterwards, Sections \ref{sec:mcp} -- \ref{sec:mdcp} show definitions for the problems considered in this thesis, starting with the Maximum Clique Problem, from which all considered problems are derived. Additionally, we list notable properties of the considered problems that are relevant for developing well-performing algorithms for these problems. 

\section{Notation}\label{sec:notation}

Throughout this thesis, we use standard graph theory notation. 
We consider $G = (V, E)$ to be an undirected, simple graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V\}$. We use the terms vertex, vertices when denoting elements of $V$ in a graph $G$, and we use the terms node, nodes when denoting elements of a search graph or search tree corresponding to a search algorithm, e.g. in beam search, or nodes in a GNN. This distinction helps to keep formulations precise when for instance an algorithm that uses an internal graph structure is applied to a graph input, or to distinguish between vertices of a graph and the corresponding nodes of a GNN. 
If not stated otherwise, $n = |V|$ denotes the number of vertices in $G$, whereas $m = |E|$ denotes the number of edges. 
For a graph $G$ we also use $V(G), E(G)$ do denote its vertex set and edge set, respectively. 

A graph $G$ is \emph{simple}, if it contains no self-loops (e.g.,  $\{v,v\} \in E$) or multiple edges between two vertices. In this thesis, we only consider unweighted, undirected, simple graphs, as all the considered problems are defined on such graphs. 
A graph $G' = (V', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (V,E)$ iff $V' \subseteq V$, $E' \subseteq E$, and $\{u,v\} \in E' \colon u,v \in V'$. Let $S \subseteq V$ be a set of vertices in $G$. The subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$, denoted as $G[S]$, is a graph with vertex set $S$ and edge set $E(S) = \{ \{u,v\} \mid \{u,v\} \in E, u,v \in S \}$. 
The \emph{diameter} of a graph $G$ is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices in $G$. 

A \emph{clique} is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $G[S]$ is fully connected, i.e., $|E(S)| = \frac{|S| \cdot (|S|-1)}{2}$. A fully connected graph on $n$ vertices is denoted as $K_n$. A clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-clique, and this convention is also applied to clique relaxation models: A $\gamma$-quasi clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique, an $s$-defective clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$s$-defective clique, etc. 

The density $\mathrm{dens}(G)$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as the ratio of the number of edges $|E|$ to the number of edges in a fully-connected graph with $|V|$ vertices $\binom{|V|}{2}$. 
The density of a graph is therefore a rational number between zero and one. 

The open neighborhood of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G = (V,E)$, denoted as $N_G(v) = \{ w \mid v \in V, \{v,w\} \in E\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, whereas the closed neighborhood of $v$, denoted as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, and $v$ itself. 
If the graph $G$ is clear from context, we use $N(v)$ or $N[v]$ to denote the open and closed neighborhoods of $v$, respectively. 
The neighborhood of a set of vertices is defined similarly: For $S \subseteq V$, let $N_G(S) = \bigcup_{v \in S} N_G(v) \setminus S$ be the open neighborhood of $S$ in $G$, and let $N_G[S] = N_G(S) \cup S$ be the closed neighborhood of $S$ in $G$. 

The degree of a vertex $v$ in a simple graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as $\mathrm{deg}(v) = |N_G(v)|$, which is the number of adjacent vertices for a vertex $v \in V$. Generalizing the concept of vertex degrees, for $S \subseteq V$, let $d_S(v) = |\{w \mid \{v,w\} \in E, w \in S\}|$ be the number of vertices in $S$ that are adjacent to $v \in V$. As can be seen, $\mathrm{deg}(v) = d_V(v) $ for all $v \in V$. 


\section{The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP)}\label{sec:mcp}

The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science. Its decision variant was one of first problems that were shown to be NP-Complete \cite{Karp1972}, from which NP-hardness can be derived for the maximization variant. The MCP is a well-studied problem and has many real-world applications, e.g., in network analysis \cite{Fortunato09}, \cite{Palla2005}, bioinformatics \cite{Depolli2013}, \cite{BUTENKO20061}, circuit design \cite{LeckyMA89}, and telecommunication \cite{DouikSAA14}. 
Figure \ref{fig:maxclique} depicts a maximum clique in a graph.

    \label{fig:maxclique}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Maximum Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is the problem of finding clique of maximum size in $G$. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Relaxations of the MCP}

For some real-world applications, the MCP is too strict a model, as some applications require identifying large, dense subgraphs, but not necessarily fully connected subgraphs. 
Furthermore, it might be the case that acquiring real-world data is an error-prone process, thus requiring relaxations of the clique model tailored to the specific application. 
For these reasons, several relaxations of the maximum clique problem have been introduced: The Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem \cite{Abello2002} and the Maximum $s$-Defective Clique Problem \cite{Yu2006} are density based and edge based relaxations, respectively, where a solution $S$ is a set of vertices with a given minimum density $\gamma$, or has at most a given number of $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$. 
The Maximum $s$-plex Problem is a degree based relaxation \cite{Seidman1978}, where each vertex in a solution $S$ is required to have at least $|S| - s$ neighbors in $S$, and the Maximum $s$-club Problem \cite{Mokken1979} is a path-based relaxation, where the induced subgraph $G[S]$ must have a diameter of at most $s$. Other relaxations include $s$-blocks, $s$-bundles and $s$-cores \cite{Gschwind2015}, among others. 

\subsection{Properties of the MCP}

In graph theory, a property $P$ of a graph $G$ is \textit{hereditary} if $P$ also holds for all induced subgraphs of $G$ \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. It is easy to see that the property of a graph being a clique is hereditary, as each subset of a clique is a clique itself. Heredity is an important concept in the context of graph theory, as it allows the development of algorithms that exploit the structure of solutions exhibited by heredity, e.g. \cite{Trukhanov2013} and \cite{GSCHWIND2018131}.  

There exist negative results about the hardness of approximating the maximum clique in a graph in polynomial time: In \cite{Hastad1999} and \cite{Zuckerman2007} the authors show that there exists no fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the MCP, unless $\mathit{P} = \mathit{NP}$, meaning that for a real number $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique in a graph with a factor of at least $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. More importantly, these hardness results are trivially also valid for relaxations of the MCP. Considering the hardness of approximability of the MCP and its relaxations, it is evident that heuristic approaches are of great importance when tackling large real-world instances that cannot be solved optimally in practice. 

\section{The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP)}\label{sec:mqcp}

The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem is a density based relaxation of the MCP, which was first introduced by Abello et al. \cite{Abello2002}. Pattillo et al. show that for any $\gamma$ with $0 < \gamma < 1$, the problem is NP-complete in its decision variant \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mqcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1]$, the Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has an edge density of at least $\gamma$, or, in other words, $G[S]$ contains at least $\gamma \binom{|S|}{2}$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MQCP}
In contrast to cliques, the property of being a quasi-clique is not hereditary. Algorithms which build upon heredity can therefore not easily be adapted to the MQCP. However, as noted in \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}, quasi-cliques display a property which the authors call \textit{quasi-heredity}. A property $P$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is \textit{quasi-hereditary}, if there exists some $v \in V$ such that $G[V \setminus \{v\}]$ also has property $P$. Furthermore, the authors show that quasi-cliques are quasi-hereditary. Therefore, for a $\gamma$-quasi-clique of size $k$ there exists a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of size $1,2, \dots, k$ such that each $\gamma$-quasi clique is a strict subset of the next one. Most of the leading heuristic algorithms for the MQCP (e.g., \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}) build upon this important property by searching for a sequence of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of increasing size in order to approximate the maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph. 

\subsection{Preprocessing of MQCP Instances}

In \cite{Abello2002}, the authors introduce the notion of $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices in the context of preprocessing. A vertex $v$ is $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} if $v$ and all its neighbors have degree smaller than $\gamma k$. If a lower bound $k$ for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique is known, the authors propose to remove all edges incident to $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices from $G$ in preprocessing. This preprocessing rule might be used to speed up the search process by sparsifying the graph, but we note that this preprocessing rule does not necessarily preserve the existence of optimal solutions. We prove this claim by giving a counterexample in Figure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}, where the optimal solution cannot be obtained after applying said preprocessing rule.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Consider the graph $G$ given in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub1}. The considered MQCP instance is defined by $G$ consisting of a $K_3$ and a $K_7$ connected by an edge and $\gamma=0.5$. Since $G$ has a density $\mathrm{dens}(G) = \frac{25}{45} \approx 0.56$, the maximum $0.5$-quasi clique in $G$ is $V$. Assume a lower bound of $k=6$ is known, therefore the two vertices on the left are $k\gamma$\emph{-peelable} and preprocessing would remove all edges incident to these vertices, as can be seen in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub2}. Therefore, the density of this preprocessed graph would be reduced to $\frac{22}{45} \approx 0.49$ and the optimal solution $V$ would not be preserved.}
    \label{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}
\end{figure}

\section{The Maximum Defective Clique Problem (MDCP)}\label{sec:mdcp}

The Maximum Defective Clique Problem was first introduced in \cite{Yu2006} in the context of predicting protein-protein interactions. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum $s$-defective-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mdcp}
	Given a graph \\ 
    $G = (V,E)$ and integer $s$, the Maximum $s$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains at least $\binom{|S|}{2} - s$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MDCP}

Although the MQCP and the MDCP are similar relaxations of the MCP, there are some key differences between the problems. It can easily be seen that the property of being a $s$-defective clique is hereditary: If $S$ is an $s$-defective clique with at most $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$, the removal of a vertex $v \in S$ cannot ``introduce'' any new missing edges.  
However, for a fixed size $k$, the two problems become interreducible: 
Finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique with $\gamma = \frac{\binom{k}{2} - s}{\binom{k}{2}} $, and finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique, where $s = \binom{k}{2} - \lceil \gamma \binom{k}{2} \rceil$. 
When approximating the maximum $s$-defective clique in a graph $G$ by a series of $s$-defective cliques of increasing size, the problem can therefore be reduced to finding a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques and vice-versa.

Problems that are defined on graphs, e.g. the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), pose new challenges in utilizing machine learning effectively: Utilized methods should be able to effectively capture and exploit the structure of input graphs, while taking into account that graphs do not have a unique representation and no fixed order of vertices, i.e. they should be \emph{order invariant}. Furthermore, graphs of all sizes should be considered as input, therefore utilized methods need to be \emph{scale invariant}. Ideally, the results of the training should generalize on unseen instances that might also be of different size than the instances seen during training. In order to address these challenges, researches have come up with machine learning architectures known as GNNs. 

The authors of \cite{Sperduti1997} were the first to research the application of neural networks on graphs. Since then, many researches have advanced the field by developing new architectures and methods. 
A comprehensive overview of the taxonomy of GNNs and a review of applications and methods can be found in \cite{Wu2019} and \cite{Zhou2020}. 

In \cite{Wu2019}, GNNs are classified into four main categories: Recurrent GNNs, Convolutional GNNs (ConvGNNs), Graph autoencoders, and Spatial-temporal graph neural networks. In the following, we conform to the authors' definitions of GNN-related concepts. 
ConvGNNs can further be categorized as spectral-based and spatial-based GNNs. Spectral-based GNNs are based on signal processing theory, and a graph is in this context thus seen as a signal which is transformed to a spectral domain by a graph Fourier transform. The convolution operation is then conducted in the spectral domain, whereafter the graph signal is transformed back using the inverse graph Fourier transform. 
In contrast, spatial-based ConvGNNs apply convolution operations directly on the input graph based on its topology. 
In the context of our work, spatial-based ConvGNNs are the most relevant.

The Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) \cite{GilmerSRVD17} is a framework of spatial-based ConvGNNs, which captures several different concrete realizations due to its generality. 
Here, information corresponding to vertex $v$ in a graph is represented by a feature vector $x_v$, and convolution operations are defined to aggregate information of the neighboring vertices by passing messages over the edges of the graph. A convolutional layer then aggregates the features of neighboring vertices for all vertices in the graph. The general idea of this convolution operation is sketched in Figure \ref{fig:conv-gnn}, 
where the updated value for vertex $v_0$ is computed by aggregating the messages passed from its neighbors. MPNN uses a fixed number of layers to compute the final node embeddings. 
More precisely, to update the representation $h_v^{(k)}$ of a node $v$ in layer $k$, the following message passing function is applied: 

\[
    h_v^{(k)} = U_k (h_v^{(k-1)}, \sum_{u \in N_G(v)} M_k(h_v^{(k-1)}, h_u^{(k-1)}, x_{vu}^{e}))
\]
Here, $U_k(\cdot), M_k(\cdot)$ are functions with learnable parameters, $h_v^{(0)} = x_v$, and $x_{vu}^{e}$ is the feature vector of the (directed) edge from $v$ to $u$. Note that edge features are however not required, as also our work in this thesis utilizes spatial-based ConvGNNs on graphs that only contain information about vertices, but not about edges. 
The functions $U_k, M_k$ can be realized by any learnable function and thus cover many concrete realizations of the concept, for example $M_k$ can be an Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that takes the concatenation of $(h_v^{(k-1)}, h_u^{(k-1)}, x_{vu}^{e})$ as inputs to compute its message, and $U_k$ is often realized by a ReLU activation function, followed by a batch-normalization \cite{IoffeS15} layer with learnable parameters. 

In recent years, researchers have developed attention-based spatial ConvGNNs (e.g., \cite{Velickovic2018}, \cite{Zhang2018}, \cite{Brody2021}) in order to translate the popular attention mechanism, which was originally introduced in the context of sequence-based tasks (\cite{Bahdanau2015}, \cite{VaswaniSPUJGKP17}), to graph-based tasks. In contrast to the basic spatial-based convolution operator discussed before, attention-based convolution operators assign different weights for different neighbors in an attempt to filter noise and focus the ``attention'' only on the most relevant information. 
Most prominently, the graph attention network (GAT) proposed in \cite{Velickovic2018} computes the state of a node $v$ by the following update function: 
\[
    h_v^{(k)} = \rho \big( \sum_{u \in N_G[v]} \alpha_{vu} W h_u^{(k-1)} \big),
\]
\[ 
    \alpha_{vu} = \frac{\exp(\mathrm{LeakyReLU}(a^T[Wh_v \; || \; Wh_u]))}{\sum_{w \in N_G[v]} \exp(\mathrm{LeakyReLU}(a^T[Wh_v \; ||\; Wh_w]))},
\]
where $W$ is a weight matrix of learnable parameters, and $a$ is the weight vector of a single-layer perceptron. 
In \cite{Brody2021}, the authors present another variant named GATv2, in which they slightly change the update function of a layer by changing the attention coefficients:  
\[
    \alpha_{vu} = \exp(a^T \mathrm{LeakyReLU(W^{(k)}h_v^{(k-1)} + W h_u^{(k-1)} )}),    
\]
According to the authors, this simple modification makes a significant difference, and they validate their claim by showing that there exist problems, where GATv2 greatly outperforms the previous GAT layers. 
Another important property of the GAT architecture is the utilization of multi-head attention proposed in \cite{VaswaniSPUJGKP17}. 
Here, a fixed number $K$ of multiple independent attention head mechanisms are applied and then either concatenates their features or computes the element-wise mean. 

GNNs can be used for different tasks such as node-level tasks, e.g. the classification of nodes in a graph, edge-level tasks, e.g. edge classification or link prediction, or graph-level tasks, e.g. graph classification, both in supervised and unsupervised learning settings.

\section{Machine Learning in Combinatorial Optimization}\label{sec:ml-co}

In many exact and heuristic algorithms for COPs, ML techniques are a determining factor in the effectiveness of said algorithms. There a many ways ML can be applied: It can be used in an end-to-end fashion to directly produce a solution, to replace or enhance key components of existing algorithms, e.g., by obtaining quick approximations for otherwise computationally heavy parts of an algorithm, to provide additional information to heuristics or metaheuristic, or to make decisions within an algorithm, e.g. variable selection in branch-and-bound algorithms. A driving motivation in utilizing ML in COPs thus is to (partially) automate the process of hand-crafting heuristic algorithm components. 

Most of the current ML-based approaches are based on supervised learning, as stated in \cite{Cappart2021}. This often requires labeled training data in the form of optimal solutions to computationally hard problems, which is a great restriction. 
The two most common approaches to tackle this challenge are to either limit the training data to only incorporate labeled data of small instances that can be solved optimally within reasonable time, or to use high quality approximations, and thus decrease the solution quality. The former approach additionally poses the challenge to develop methods that translate well to unseen and possibly larger real-world instances that are relevant in practice. 
A prominent example of this application is \cite{Li2018}, where a GNN is trained to predict whether a vertex in the graph is in an optimal solution. A tree search algorithm is then executed that uses the information provided by the GNN. The approach generalizes well to instances that are much larger than those seen during training, and the authors apply it to multiple different COPs. 

Other approaches are based on unsupervised reinforcement learning and do not require labeled training data. 
In \cite{Khalil2017}, the authors propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which generalizes well to a wide range of problems. 
Furthermore, recent advances in this field have also been made by researchers of combinatorial games. Especially AlphaGo Zero is a prominent example, which was used to train models that excel in the board games Chess and Go via repeated self-play. AlphaGo Zero was later adapted in \cite{Abe2019} and applied to several combinatorial optimization problems, including Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Cut. 
In \cite{Kool2019} and \cite{Joshi2021}, the authors present end-to-end ML approaches by utilizing GNNs for routing problems including the Euclidean TSP. While their work shows promise, the proposed methods are only available for relatively small graphs, where exact approaches are available. In \cite{Hudson2021}, the authors present a guided local search approach, where a GNN is used to provide additional information to enhance the metaheuristic search, leading to improved results when applied to the TSP. Again, only relatively small instances are considered. 
We refer to \cite{Cappart2021} for a comprehensive overview of GNNs in the context of combinatorial optimization for both heuristic and exact algorithms. 

In the context of the MCP, several ML based approaches have been made. In \cite{Kristjan2022}, the authors build upon an exact branch-and-bound algorithm for the MCP, that uses an empirically determined algorithm parameter that greatly affects the algorithm's performance. The authors thus enhance the algorithm by training a GNN model to predict suitable parameter settings for each input graph. 
In \cite{Sun2021}, ML is applied to reduce MCP instances by training models to predict, whether a vertex is in an optimal solution or not. The input graph is then reduced, and an exact algorithm is applied to the reduced instance. 
Furthermore, in \cite{Yan2022}, the authors propose a metaheuristic breakout local search for the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (a degree-based MCP relaxation) that uses reinforcement learning in the diversification stage of the algorithm in order to predict good parameter settings for the diversification. Finally, a Pointer-Network based deep learning algorithm for the MCP is presented in \cite{Gu2020}. 
To the best of our knowledge, there are no ML-based or GNN-based approaches to the MQCP or the MDCP. 

\section{Node Representation Learning}\label{sec:node-representation}

As with other ML methods, the choice of input features can affect the performance greatly when utilizing GNNs. 
Some problems like the 2D Euclidean TSP are defined on graphs, where each vertex of the input graph is embedded in a 2D plane. It is therefore natural to use the 2D coordinates of each vertex as input features in any GNN based task related to this problem. 
However, many problems and tasks utilizing GNNs are defined on inherently featureless, or non-attributed input graphs. 
To tackle this challenge, researchers have come up with two different approaches regarding feature initialization. The first approach is to use centrality-based input features that can be derived directly from the graph, e.g. the degree of a vertex in the graph. Secondly, researches have come up with learning-based approaches that try to extract input features directly from the graph structure. In \cite{Duong2019} the authors investigate both centrality-based and learning-based feature initialization methods and evaluate the quality of the produced feature embeddings in a node-level classification task on several well-established benchmark sets. The results of the authors' experiments show that learning-based approaches outperform centrality-based feature initialization methods. 

One of the most popular approaches in node representation learning is based on ideas from natural language processing (NLP) and word representation learning. In \cite{Mikolov2013}, the authors propose their method word2vec, which was developed to embed words into an embedding space such that words with a similar meaning are mapped closer together. While in other NLP tasks it is common to predict the next word in a sequence from a context, word2vec turns the problem on its head and tries to predict the context from a word, where the context is defined as the words that appear at a certain distance before and after a word. 
In \cite{Perozzi2014}, the authors present DeepWalk, which translates this idea to node representation learning by sampling random walks of a fixed length from a graph and by considering the vertices of the graph as a vocabulary and the random walks as sentences over this vocabulary. Here, a random walk starts at some vertex, and at each step of the random walk, a random neighbor that can be reached from the current vertex is chosen as the successor, and all neighbors of a node are equally likely to be chosen. Multiple random walks are sampled, starting from each vertex of the graph. 
The node embeddings are initialized randomly. Each random walk is then used as a sentence to update the embeddings using the SkipGram language model, as in word2vec. This is done by maximizing for each vertex appearing in a random walk the probability of predicting the vertices that appear at a fixed distance before and after said vertex. The authors use stochastic gradient descent to maximize said probability and show the success of their proposed method by evaluating the learned representations in a multi-label classification task. 

Node2Vec \cite{GroverL16} builds upon DeepWalk and introduces another method to sample random walks from graphs, which the authors call second order random walks. Here, two hyperparameters $p, q$ are introduced to provide additional control over the exploration of the graph during random walks. 
Assuming a random walk just traversed an edge $(t, v)$, a successor is then chosen among the neighbors of $v$ by assigning each neighbor $x$ of $v$ an unnormalized transition probability $\pi_{vx} = \alpha_{pq}(t,x) \cdot w_{vx}$, defined as  
\[
    \alpha_{pq}(t,x) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{p} & \text{ if } d_{tx} = 0 \\
        1 & \text{ if } d_{tx} = 1 \\
        \frac{1}{q} & \text{ if } d_{tx} = 2 
    \end{cases},    
\] 
where $w_{vx}$ is the edge weight of edge $(v,x)$ and $d_{tx}$ is the distance of the shortest path between $t$ and $x$ (a small example is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:node2vec}). The next vertex in the random walk is chosen by selecting a vertex from the neighborhood of $v$ by weighted sampling according to the normalized transition probabilities. 
The parameter $p$ then controls the probability of returning to the most recently visited vertex, whereas the parameter $q$ controls the probability of either staying close to a vertex $t$ or exploring regions of the graph at a greater distance from $t$. The authors show that different parameterizations can be used to capture either homophily and structural equivalence in the produced embeddings. 

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{graphics/node2vec.eps}
    \caption{Illustration of the definition of unnormalized transition probabilities for a random walk that just traversed the edge $(t,v)$ and is computing the transition probabilities for its successor. Figure recreated from \cite{GroverL16}.}
    \label{fig:node2vec}
\end{figure}

While Node2Vec is able to capture some structural similarities between vertices in the input graph, it only does so if vertices are at a certain maximum distance of each other, as the random walks traverse the edges of the original graph. Struct2Vec \cite{FigueiredoRS17} is a method for learning node representations from structural identity alone, not considering locality. 
This is done by creating a multi-layer graph, where each layer is composed of a complete graph containing the vertices of the original graph, but edges between the vertices are weighted by their structural similarity. 
For a vertex $v$, let $R_k(v)$ be the set of vertices at distance $k$ from $v$, but cannot be reached by a path of length $< k$ from $v$. 
The authors define the structural similarity of two vertices $u,v$ in layer $k$ in the multi-layer graph as the similarity between the ordered degree sequences of the vertex sets $R_k(u), R_k(v)$.
Let $A, B$ be the ordered degree sequences of the vertex sets $R_k(u), R_k(v)$. The authors define the distance between two elements $a \in A, b \in B$ in the sequences as 
\[
    d(a,b) = \frac{\max(a,b)}{\min(a,b) } - 1.
\]
The similarity between two degree sequences is then computed by dynamic time warping, which is a method used to find the optimal alignment between two sequences that minimizes the proposed distance function. The edge weights of layer $k$ in the multi-layer graph are therefore set to be the result of this computation. 
Random walks are then sampled from the constructed multi-layer graph. Before each step, the walk can decide to go one layer up or down the multi-layer graph. A neighbor on the current layer is then chosen by weighted sampling, considering the edge weights of the current layer. 
The authors show that the proposed method of sampling random walks from a multi-layer graph can capture structural similarities despite vertices being far apart in the input graph. 

% other notable concepts
Other notable approaches in node representation learning include HOPE \cite{Mingdong2016}, which was developed specifically to preserve properties of directed graphs and DeepGL \cite{Rossi17a}, which is a deep learning framework for node representation learning that is designed such that learned embeddings transfer well across different networks. Beyond the scope of node representation learning much research has also been done in other areas of network representation learning, e.g. edge representation learning and graph representation learning. In our work we chose to consider and evaluate primarily Node2Vec and Struct2Vec, as these methods are simple to implement and seem the most suited to our application, as they are able to capture local and structural features for non-attributed graphs. 


\section{Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem}\label{sec:mqcp-related-work}

\subsection{Exact Approaches}\label{milp-mqcp}
Pattillo et al. \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013} propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation with a number of variables that is quadratic in the size of the vertex set $V$. 
It is derived from the following quadratic formulation, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ are binary decision variables representing the solution set $S \subseteq V$, and $a_{ij}$ represent elements of the adjacency matrix with $a_{ij}$ equal to one if $\{i,j\} \in E$ and zero otherwise: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i  \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j \geq \gamma \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n x_i x_j 
\end{align}
The authors linearize the above quadratic formulation by introducing variables $w_{ij}$ defined as $w_{ij} = x_i x_j$ in their MILP-formulation named F1: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i &\\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n (\gamma - a_{ij}) w_{ij} \leq 0  &\\
     & w_{ij} \leq x_i & \forall \{i,j\} \in E\\
     & w_{ij} \leq x_j & \forall \{i, j\} \in E\\
     & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1 & \forall \{i, j\} \in E\\
    & w_{ij} \geq 0 & \forall \{i, j\} \in E \\
    & x_i \in \{0,1\} & i \in V
\end{align}

Furthermore, the authors propose a second MILP-formulation F2 that has a number of variables that is linear in $n$, but their computational experiments show that the above formulation performs better in practice on most of the evaluated instances. 

In \cite{VeremyevPBP16}, the authors propose two additional MILP-formulation. 
In one of their proposed MILP-models which is named F3, they utilize an upper and lower bound in order to provide a tighter formulation than the ones from \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. As a lower bound $\omega^{\ell}$, the size of any known $\gamma$-quasi clique can be used, whereas the upper bound is defined as  $\omega^u = \lfloor \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 + 8\frac{|E|}{\gamma}} \rfloor$. The proposed formulation F3 is then defined as: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i \in V} x_i \\
    \text{s.t.} & \sum_{(i,j) \in E} y_{ij} \geq \gamma \sum_{k = \omega^{\ell}}^{\omega^u} \frac{k(k-1)}{2} z_k \\
    & y_{ij} \leq x_i & \forall(i,j) \in E \\
    & y_{ij} \leq x_j & \forall(i,j) \in E \\
    & \sum_{i \in V} x_i = \sum_{k = \omega^{\ell}}^{\omega^u} k z_k & \\
    & \sum_{k = \omega^{\ell}}^{\omega^u} z_k = 1 \\
    & x_i \in \{0,1\} & \forall i \in V \\
    & y_{ij} \geq 0 & \forall i, j \in V, i < j\\
    & z_k \geq 0 & \forall k \in \{\omega^{\ell}, \dots, \omega^u\}
\end{align}

Compared to the formulation F1 in \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}, the authors introduce a variable $z_k$, that is used to determine the size of the solution $S$, i.e. $z_k = 1$ iff $|S| = k$. Clearly, providing tight upper and lower bounds $\omega^{\ell}, \omega^u$ has a great effect on the performance of this model. The authors evaluate their formulations and show both theoretically and empirically that they outperform the previously mentioned formulations F1 and F2, and that the formulations are especially effective on sparse graphs. Dense graphs with $|V| > 100$ however are infeasible to solve in practice using any of the proposed formulations. 

In \cite{ribeiro_exact_2019}, the authors propose a branch-and-bound algorithm that is able to outperform the previously mentioned MILP-formulations on dense graphs of sizes of up to $100$ vertices. Furthermore, they propose a new method to calculate upper bounds for the size of a maximum-quasi clique, which provides much tighter upper bounds than previously known methods. A MILP-formulation with an exponential number of variables is proposed in \cite{marinelli_lp-based_2021}. The authors also present a branch-and-price algorithm that can be used for column generation in the context of their presented formulation. 

Despite the advances in the research of exact methods regarding the MQCP, the problem proves to be extremely computationally challenging. In practice, only graphs that are sufficiently small or sparse are feasible to solve using any of the discussed exact methods. 

\subsection{Heuristic Approaches}

As already discussed, large and dense MQCP instances are infeasible to solve in practice due to the computational complexity of the problem. Researchers have therefore come up with several fast heuristic solution approaches that yield in practice often good, or even near-to-optimal solutions that can be used on large real-world instances. 
Early heuristic work on the MQCP dates back to 2002~\cite{Abello2002}, where the authors are the first to formally define the problem and propose a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) as a first heuristic solution approach. A GRASP iteration typically consists of two phases - an initial candidate solution is given by a greedy randomized construction heuristic, followed by improvements through local search. In \cite{Brunato2008}, the authors present two stochastic algorithms based on the local search paradigm. A distributed algorithm for mining quasi-cliques in large graphs based on the MapReduce programming model is presented in \cite{Khosraviani2011}, and in \cite{oliveira2013construction} the authors present a restart iterative greedy algorithm named RIG. 

In recent years, several heuristic solution approaches have been presented. In \cite{pinto2015biased}, \cite{pinto_biased_2018}, and \cite{pinto2021brkga} the authors present variations of a genetic algorithm for the MQCP. The authors' latest work on the MQCP, \cite{pinto2021brkga}, shows the best performance out of the three variations. It is based on the hybridization of their previously proposed genetic algorithm and a local search strategy. 

A multi-start tabu search algorithm is presented in \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}. It builds upon an adaptive multistart tabu search algorithm that was initially proposed for the MCP. The authors offer an analysis of the considered neighborhood structures used during the tabu search and adapt the intensification and diversification mechanisms of this algorithm to be suitable for the MQCP. The results of the computational experiments by the authors show that the performance of their tabu search algorithm is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art and performs well on established benchmark instances. 

Furthermore, in \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, an opposition-based memetic algorithm (OBMA) for the MQCP is presented. The authors combine the ideas of using a genetic algorithm to build a population of candidate solutions with a tabu search that is used to improve these solutions. Their main contribution is the incorporation of an opposition-based construction heuristic. Every time an offspring, which corresponds to a candidate solution $S$, is created by means of a recombination operator, another offspring $\overline{S}$ is created that does not share any vertices with $S$. Both opposing individuals $S, \overline{S}$ are then improved by a tabu search procedure, and the indiviual that leads to a better solution through tabu search is then added to the population. The authors compare the performance of their algorithm to RIG~\cite{oliveira2013construction}, and three variations of BRKGA \cite{pinto2015biased},\cite{pinto_biased_2018}, \cite{pinto2021brkga} and show that their algorithm outperforms these approaches.

In \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, another local search based algorithm is presented. The authors make two main contributions to existing local search based approaches: Firstly, they identify weaknesses in the scoring function used to determine, which vertices should be used during iterations of the local search procedure. Their computational experiments show that in most iterations, there are several vertices with the same score, thus they provide a secondary scoring function that serves as a tiebreaker. The value of this secondary scoring function is proportional to the number of iterations that a vertex was not moved during local search, thus it strongly encourages exploration of the search space. Secondly, they replace the commonly used tabu list by configuration checking, which is another short term memory type that can be used to prevent cycling through the search space. The authors present their own variation of configuration checking, which they call BoundedCC. 
In general, configuration checking is a short term memory mechanism that blocks a vertex $v$ from being considered in local search until one of its (unblocked) neighbors is moved. BoundedCC refines this strategy by keeping track of the values $\mathit{confChange(v)}, \mathit{threshold(v)}$, and it is parameterized by a user-defined value $\mathit{ub\_threshold} \in \mathbb{N}$. A vertex is blocked, if $\mathit{confChange(v)} < \mathit{threshold(v)}$ holds. There are three update rules that are defined as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{BoundedCC-InitialRule.} Initially, for all $v \in V$ set $\mathit{confChange(v)} = 1$, \\$\mathit{threshold(v)} = 1$. 
    \item \emph{BoundedCC-AddRule.} When $v$ is added into the candidate solution, for all $u \in N_G(v)$, $\mathit{confChange(u)}$ is increased by one and $\mathit{threshold(v)}$ is increased by one as well. If $\mathit{threshold}(v) > \mathit{ub\_threshold}$, $\mathit{threshold(v)}$ will be reset to 1. 
    \item \emph{BoundedCC-RemoveRule.} When $v$ is removed from the candidate solution, set $confChange(v) = 0$. 
\end{itemize}
The authors compare their algorithm to those presented in \cite{pinto2021brkga}, \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020} and show that their algorithm outperforms similar algorithms in terms of solution quality and runtime. 

Finally, the most recent heuristic solution approach for the MQCP at the time of writing this thesis is presented in \cite{peng_solving_2021}. Here, the authors propose a hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm (HBAC), which incorporates an opposition-based construction phase and then adapts the artificial bee colony framework to the MQCP. The algorithm again uses tabu search to improve initially constructed candidate solutions. 
The authors report new best results on several instances that were not included in the evaluation of \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}. A comparison is made only with RIG~\cite{oliveira2013construction}, and \cite{pinto2015biased}, \cite{pinto_biased_2018}, and \cite{pinto2021brkga}, which are outperformed on other instances by \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021} and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}. 

As we have extensively studied the literature regarding heuristic solution approaches, we found that most state-of-the-art methods are based on or utilize metaheuristics based on the local search paradigm. Therefore, we let previous work on the MQCP lead our way and plan to build our work upon the local search paradigm as well. 

\section{Maximum Defective Clique Problem}\label{sec:mdcp-related-work}

Compared to the MQCP, only a few solution approaches have been proposed for the MDCP. 
The first algorithm is proposed in \cite{Yu2006}, along with the first formal definition of the problem. The authors develop their approach for the use case of link prediction for protein-protein interactions. Even before that, the problem has been considered in the context of transportation planning \cite{Sherali2002}, where MILP formulations of the problem are analyzed and discussed. 
Note that, similar to the MQCP, there is a straight-forward MILP-formulation as presented in \cite{Sherali2006}: 
\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i \in V} x_i &\\
    \text{s.t.} & \sum_{\{i,j\} \in \overline{E}} z_{ij} \leq k &\\
    & z_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1 & \forall \{i,j\} \in \overline{E} \\
    & z_{ij} \geq 0 & \forall \{i,j\} \in \overline{E} \\
    & x_i \in \{0,1\} & \forall i \in V  
\end{align}
Here, $\overline{E}$ denotes the set $\{\{i,j\} \mid \{i,j\} \notin E\}$, i.e. the set of edges that are not in $E$. 

In \cite{Trukhanov2013}, the authors analyze several MCP relaxations from the perspective of hereditary properties in graphs. They show that the property of being a defective clique is a non-trivial, interesting property that is hereditary on induced subgraphs, and that the NP-hardness of the problem follows from this observation. Furthermore, the authors propose an exact algorithm based on Russian Doll Search (RDS) that can be used to solve MCP relaxations that are hereditary. In \cite{GSCHWIND2018131}, the RDS algorithm is revisited and improved by new pre-processing procedures. 
More recently, exact solution approaches are proposed in~\cite{chen2021computing} and~\cite{gao2022exact} specifically to exploit massive sparse graphs. 

When studying the literature related to the MDCP, we notice that there is a lack of heuristic approaches. Due to the close relation of the MQCP and the MDCP we hope that our algorithm can also be used for the MDCP with only slight adaptions, which is why we focus our approach to build upon existing heuristic algorithms for the MQCP. 

\chapter{A Local Search Based Metaheuristic for Edge-Based Relaxations of the Maximum Clique Problem}\label{chp:local-search-algorithm}

In this chapter we present a \underline{l}ocal \underline{s}earch \underline{b}ased \underline{m}etaheuristic, named LSBM, for relaxations of the MCP in detail, which is the algorithmic foundation of the GNN-based algorithm presented in Chapter~\ref{chp:gnn}. 
At first, we introduce the general structure of LSBM without using GNNs in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm-structure}, followed by a detailed inspection of the components of our algorithm. We propose a lower bound heuristic based on beam search (BS) in Section \ref{sec:lower-bound-heuristic} that is used to efficiently obtain a feasible initial solution of high quality. 
Next, we discuss the construction heuristic used within LSBM in Section~\ref{sec:construction-heuristic}. This construction heuristic does not necessarily yield a feasible solution, but is used to explore new regions of the search space not visited yet, as it will be used as a starting point for the local search procedure. 
The main move operator used in the local search procedure is defined in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood-structure}. Moreover, we define analyze the corresponding neighborhood structures. 
Thereafter, we show in detail the local search procedure of LSBM that searches said neighborhood structures and uses a scoring function to evaluate the vertices in the graph in order to restrict the neighborhood to the most promising moves. We introduce such a scoring function, namely the function $d_S$, that denotes for a vertex in the input graph the number of neighbors in the current candidate solution $S$. This scoring function is commonly used in state-of-the-art heuristic approaches for the MQCP, but we also discuss that any other scoring function can be used within LSBM. 

Note that we present our algorithm in the context of the MQCP. As the MQCP and the MDCP are closely related, the adaption to the MDCP is straight-forward and the necessary steps to adapt LSBM to the MDCP are shown at the end of the Chapter in Section~\ref{sec:adaption-to-mdcp}. 

\section{Algorithm Structure} \label{sec:algorithm-structure}

As noted by Friden et al. \cite{Friden1989}, a solution for the MCP can be obtained by finding a series of $k$-cliques for increasing values of $k$. Based on this observation, Wu et al. \cite{WuH13} develop an adaptive multistart tabu search algorithm for the MCP that in each iteration searches for a clique of size $k$ using a tabu search procedure. If such a clique can be found, $k$ is increased and the algorithm is restarted. The largest clique found this way is returned as the solution. Djeddi et al. \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} show that this idea can be extended to the MQCP by following the same principle: The maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph is approximated by finding a series of $k$-$\gamma$-quasi cliques, where the tabu search is restarted with increased $k$ each time a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is found. This idea is applied successfully also in other state-of-the art algorithms for the MQCP, namely \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020} and \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, which is why we want to base the general structure of our algorithm on this idea as well. 

The pseudocode of the general structure of our local search algorithm is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure}.
$\mathit{InitialSolution}$, which is a heuristic algorithm based on BS, constructs a feasible initial solution. Its main purpose is to quickly obtain a reasonable lower bound that can be used as a starting value for $k$. The procedure is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}.

In Line \ref{alg:structure-freq} a long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ is initialized, where $\mathit{Freq[i]}$ stores how many times each vertex is operated on for $i=1,\dots,n$. This memory is kept when the loop in Lines~\ref{alg:structure-while-start}--\ref{alg:structure-while-end} is repeated, but no feasible solution could be found. In $\mathit{ConstructionHeuristic}$, $\mathit{Freq}$ is used to produce a candidate solution that favors vertices that have not been considered yet. This way, new regions of the search space are explored. The idea of using this long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ in the construction heuristic to cover a larger area of the search space comes from \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}. We change their construction heuristic slightly by combining it with a GRASP-like construction step as described in Section~\ref{sec:construction-heuristic}. 

Once a candidate solution is obtained by a construction heuristic, we try to improve it by the local search procedure in Line~\ref{alg:structure-local-search}, which is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} along with the definition of the neighborhood structures. During this local search procedure, we use the scoring function $f_S$ in each iteration to restrict the neighborhood of a candidate solution $S$ to the most promising moves in order to increase its objective value. 
If the resulting solution $S$ is feasible, a simple search is performed in $\mathit{Extend}$ to check if the solution can be extended to a feasible solution of greater size as shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:extend}. 
Furthermore, $k$ is increased, $\mathit{Freq}$ is reset, and the best-so-far found solution $S^*$ is updated. 
If the solution obtained by the local search procedure is not feasible, the while-loop is repeated until the stopping criterion is met, e.g., the time limit or a user defined maximum number of restarts is reached.

\section{Lower Bound Heuristic}\label{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}

In this section we propose a BS based heuristic that returns a feasible solution that can be used as a lower bound for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in the input graph. This lower bound is used to obtain a high starting value for $k$ in Line~\ref{alg:structure-lower-bound} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:structure}. 
The pseudocode of the beam search is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic}. 
In the following, note the textual distinction between \emph{nodes} in the search tree and \emph{vertices} in the input graph which is made for the sake of clarity. 

In BS, a node $v$ of the search tree is in general evaluated by a function $f(v) = g(v) + h(v)$, where $g(v)$ is the cost of the solution corresponding to a node, and $h(v)$ is a heuristically determined value given by a guidance function, which predicts the cost-to-go to complete the partial solution corresponding to a node. 
We use a simple data structure for nodes of the search tree where a node $v$ has fields $v.S$ containing a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique that this node represents, $v.n_e$, which contains the number of edges in $G[v.S]$, $v.d_S$, which is a vector containing the $d_S$-values for vertices in $G$ in order to allow efficient computation of $v.n_e$, and $v.h$, which is the heuristically determined value of the node according to the used guidance function.
Additionally, we define the cost of a node $v$ as $g(v) = |v.S|$, which is the size of the feasible solution that this node represents.  
The root node $r$ of the BS tree is then defined by an empty candidate set $r.S$ with $r.g=0, r.h=0, r.d_S = [0 \dots 0], r.n_e = 0$. 

The main loop in Lines~\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}--\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end} expands all nodes in the current beam into feasible successor nodes. 
Since a node $v$ represents a set of vertices $v.S$ which is a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, successor nodes are generated by checking for each vertex $u \in V \setminus v.S$ whether $v.S \cup \{u\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique. These successor nodes are then added to a set $C$, containing all expanded nodes of the next level of the search tree. 
Using the information stored in a node $v$ of the beam search tree, it can be checked in $O(1)$ whether any vertex $u \in V \setminus v.S$ in the graph can be used to extend the solution $v.S$ into a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique. Creating a successor node however takes $O(n)$ time, as the $d_S$-values for the created successor node have to be updated. 
In order to keep the computational effort low, we introduce a parameter $\varepsilon$ that controls the maximum number of successor nodes for each node in the search tree. Thus, if a node has more than $\varepsilon$ feasible successors, we add only the first $\varepsilon$ successor nodes to $C$, as can be seen in Line \ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic-expansion} of the algorithm. 

In order to avoid symmetries, i.e. nodes $u,v$ representing the same solutions such that $u.S = v.S$, we use a hash map for each level of the search tree containing all solution vertex sets that were already added for expansion. Before adding a successor node $v$ to $C$, a check is performed to make sure that a node representing $v.S$ is not already contained in $C$. 
 
Note that due to this expansion into successor nodes all the solutions corresponding to the nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, and thus the same $g$-value. 
Therefore, $g$-values can be ignored in the evaluation, and all nodes in $C$ are evaluated only by a guidance function $h$. The $\beta$ nodes with highest $h$-values then form a new beam while the remaining nodes are discarded. 
Furthermore, since all the solutions corresponding to nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, a random node is selected to update the best-so-far solution $S^*$ on each level.
Finally, when the beam becomes empty, the maximum cardinality solution is returned. 

The heuristic guidance function $h$ can have a great impact on the quality of the obtained solutions, but also the runtime of the beam search. We therefore propose three guidance functions, \emph{Greedy Construction}, \emph{Feasible Neighbors}, and \emph{Number of Edges}, which we want to consider in the context of this beam search: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Greedy Construction}. We use the result of a simple greedy construction as the value of the heuristic function $h$: Given a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$, greedily add the vertex $v = \arg \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$ if $S \cup \{v\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, where $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. 
    Ties are broken randomly. This greedy extension is repeated until the corresponding solution is maximal, i.e., no single vertex can extend the cardinality of the solution while maintaining feasibility. 
    The size of the solution obtained this way is then the return value of the guidance function $h(v)$. This greedy guidance function has a time complexity of $O(|S^*|n)$ per iteration, where $|S^*|$ is the size of the best found solution obtained by the greedy construction and $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. As $|S^*|$ is bound by $n$, the time complexity of \emph{Greedy Construction} is in $O(n^2)$ per node of the search tree. 
    \item \emph{Feasible Neighbors}. Consider the following function defined for a node $v$ in the search tree $h_{v.S} \colon V \setminus v.S \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$: 
    \[
        h_{v.S}(w) = 
        \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{ if $w$ cannot extend $v.S$ into a feasible solution}\\
            \mathit{v.d_S}(w) - \delta & \text{ if $w$ can extend $v.S$ }
        \end{cases},
    \]
    where $\delta = \lceil \gamma \cdot \frac{|v.S|\cdot (|v.S|+1)}{2} \rceil - v.n_e$, i.e. the number of edges that need to be added when extending $v.S$ into a feasible solution of size $|v.S|+1$. 
    The heuristic value $h(v)$ for a node $v$ in the search tree is then computed as the sum $\sum_{w \in V \setminus v.S} h_{v.S}(w)$. 
    For each vertex that can be used to extend $v.S$ - which we call a \emph{feasible neighbor} in this context - we count the surplus of edges that are added to $v.S$ when extending $v.S$ by this vertex. As we have access to $v.n_e$, we know that each vertex that adds at least $\frac{|v.S|\cdot|(v.S|+1)}{2} - v.n_e$ edges to the solution can be used to extend $v.S$. As the number of edges gained by adding a vertex is determined by the values in $v.d_S$, this computation can be done in time $O(n)$ per node of the search tree. 
    Furthermore, consider two nodes $u, v$ on the same level of the search tree, such that $u.n_e = v.n_e$, both nodes have the same number of feasible neighbors, but the $d_S$-values for the feasible neighbors of $u.S$ are higher than the $d_S$-values of the feasible neighbors of $u.S$. Intuitively, $u$ is more promising than $v$, as adding one of the feasible neighbors adds more edges to the corresponding solution, which is also reflected in the computation of this heuristic guidance function. 
    \item \emph{Number of Edges}. We set $h(v) = v.n_e$, which means this heuristic guidance function has a time complexity of $O(1)$. This allows for efficient computation at the cost of not obtaining much additional information. 
\end{itemize}

These heuristic guidance function differ greatly in terms of time complexity per node and information obtained in order to guide the search. As the main purpose of the lower bound heuristic proposed in this Section is to quickly obtain a good approximation, we will prioritize fast computation over solution quality. Nonetheless, for small instances, it could still be useful to consider more expensive guidance functions. 

    % \item The second guidance function takes a parameter $l$ and evaluates a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$ by calculating the sum of the $l$ vertices in $V \setminus S$ with the highest values for $d_S(u)$. This guidance function is designed to be more time-efficient than the previous one, as the computation is independent of the solution size.

\section{Construction Heuristic}\label{sec:construction-heuristic}

The construction heuristic in Line \ref{alg:structure-construction} in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure} aims to return a set of nodes $S$ of fixed size $|S| = k$ that is promising to lead to new local optima when used as a starting point for the local search procedure. The candidate solution returned by this construction heuristic is not necessarily feasible. 
The construction heuristic includes a parameter $r \in [0,1]$ which controls the balance between choosing nodes that have not been explored yet and nodes that increase the number of edges among vertices in the current candidate solution. This approach of balancing exploration and objective value is inspired by \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, where the authors use a similar strategy during construction. We combine the authors' idea with a GRASP-like construction step. The procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:exploration-construction}. 
At first, a starting node is selected by choosing a node with the lowest $Freq$-value, breaking ties randomly. In each iteration of the main while loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}-\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end}, with probability $r$ a node with the lowest $Freq$-value in $N_G(S)$ is added to the current candidate solution $S$. If $N_G(S)$ is empty, an arbitrary node with the lowest $Freq$ value from $V\setminus S$ is selected instead. 
With probability $1-r$ we perform an iteration of a GRASP-like construction step: A restricted candidate list $\mathit{RCL}$ is built by adding all nodes from $V \setminus S$ that fulfill the condition $d_S(u) \geq d_{\max} - \alpha(d_{\max} - d_{\min})$, where $d_S(u)$ denotes the number of neighbors in $S$ for a node $u \in V \setminus S$, and $d_{\max}, d_{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum values $d_S(u)$, respectively, over all nodes $u\in V \setminus S$. Here, the parameter $\alpha$ controls the balance between greediness and randomness in a GRASP-like manner: $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a greedy strategy, whereas $\alpha=1$ corresponds to a purely random strategy.

\section{Neighborhood Structure and Local Search} \label{sec:neighborhood-structure}

The neighborhood of a candidate solution $S$ is defined by a move operator that swaps a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$. The set of neighboring candidate solutions of $S$ with $|S| = k$ that can be obtained by a single swap move is therefore defined as $\Omega_1 = \{ (S \setminus \{u\}) \cup \{v\} \mid u \in S, v \in V \setminus S \}$ and has size $|\Omega_1| = k \cdot (n-k)$, which is in $O(n^2)$. Similarly, we define $\Omega_d$ for $d=1,2,3,\dots$ as the set of neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping $d$ nodes from $S$ with $d$ nodes from $V \setminus S$, obtaining a neighborhood of size $|\Omega_d| = \binom{k}{d} \cdot \binom{n-k}{d}$, which is in $O(n^{2d})$. 

In general, this definition of a neighborhood structure can be applied to many MCP relaxations. The quality of a candidate solution then depends on the considered problem. However, for the MQCP and the MDCP the definition of objective value coincides: a candidate solution $S$ is of higher quality than a neighboring solution $S^\prime$ if $G[S]$ contains more edges than $G[S']$. Thus, we define the objective function $f \colon 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ for the local search for MQCP and MDCP as the function that maps a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ to the number of edges in the induced subgraph $G[S]$. Therefore, $S$ is of higher quality than $S^\prime$ if and only if $f(S) > f(S^\prime)$. 

Similar algorithms that use local search in order to improve a candidate solution (e.g.,  \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}) only search the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for improving solutions. As the size of this neighborhood is already quadratic in $n$, the authors of the mentioned algorithms restrict the neighborhood to promising moves. A scoring function is used to find promising vertices in $V \setminus S$ and in $S$ that can be used for swaps. This scoring function is in most cases defined as $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. This way, the change in the objective function value when swapping a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$ can efficiently be calculated by $\Delta_{uv} = d_S(v) - d_S(u) - e_{uv}$, where $e_{uv} = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E$ and $e_{uv} = 0$ otherwise. 
The scoring function $d_S$ is thus used to restrict the neighborhood $\Omega_1$. 
Let $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u)$ and $d_{\max} = \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$.
Furthermore, let 
\begin{align*}
    X &= \{ u \mid u \in S,~~~~~ d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}, \\
    Y &= \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \}.
\end{align*} The neighborhood $\Omega_1$ of a candidate solution $S$ is then restricted to only those neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping a node $u \in X$ with a node $v \in Y$, as all node swaps that maximize $\Delta_{uv}$ are contained in this restricted neighborhood. 

In LSBM, we want to make use of this scoring function as well. The pseudocode for our local search procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:local-search-procedure}. Note that a scoring function $f_S$ is passed as an input parameter to the local search procedure. Within the context of LSBM, any scoring function can be used to restrict the candidate sets $X, Y$, and we plan to replace this scoring function by a GNN-based scoring function in Chapter \ref{chp:gnn}. 
For this Chapter however, we want to focus on the well-established scoring function $d_S$, i.e., $f_S$ is instantiated by $d_S$. 

In each iteration of the main while-loop in Algorithm \ref{alg:local-search-procedure} we first define the aspiration val $a$, which is the number of edges that have to be added to the current candidate solution $S$ such that $f(S) > f(S^*)$ holds. 
Then, the restricted candidate sets $X$ and $Y$ are created from the sets $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively by using the scoring function $f_S$. 
The sets $X, Y$ are created as described before, with an additional restriction: To prevent cycling through the same candidate solutions over and over again, a short-term memory mechanism is applied which prevents unblocked vertices from being chosen for a swap if they do not fulfill an aspiration criterion. 
There are two main methods that can be found in the literature, which we want to evaluate in our algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a tabu list is used to prevent cycling. Each time a vertex is added to or removed from the solution, it is added to the tabu list for a fixed number of iterations. While a vertex is in the tabu list, it is blocked and cannot be used in swaps. In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, the authors use two tabu lists: One for moving vertices out of the candidate solution, and one for adding vertices to the candidate solution. In \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a single tabu list is used for both operations. 
    \item In \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, the authors use Configuration Checking. In its simplest form, once a vertex $v$ is moved out of the candidate Solution, it is blocked from being moved again until at least one neighbor of $v$ is moved. The authors refine this strategy by using a threshold for each node $v$ that starts with $\mathit{threshold}(v) = 1$ for all $v \in V$. Each time a vertex $v$ is moved into the candidate solution, $\mathit{threshold}(v)$ is increased by 1. When $v$ is moved out of the candidate solution, it is blocked from being moved again, until $\mathit{threshold}(v)$ of its neighbors have been moved. Additionally, if $\mathit{threshold}(v) > \mathit{ub\_threshold}$, where $\mathit{ub\_threshold}$ is a user-defined upper bound, then $\mathit{threshold}(v)$ is reset to 1. 
\end{itemize}
In Line \ref{alg:local-search-procedure-search-neighborhood}, the neighborhood defined by $X, Y$ is searched. The subroutine is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:search-neighborhood}. The neighborhood is searched exhaustively for the swap that maximizes the gain of edges $\Delta_{uv}$. Blocked vertices are not considered for potential swaps, unless the respective gain of edges is greater than the aspiration value $a$. 
If no improving swap was found, a random unblocked move is chosen $u \in X, v \in Y$. 
Afterwards, the chosen vertices $u ,v$ are swapped and $\mathit{Freq}$, the short-term memory, and the $d_S$ values are updated correspondingly. 
Furthermore, we define as stopping criteria: If the best solution $S^*$ does not improve for a fixed amount of iterations $\mathit{max\_iter}$, the procedure is stopped and $S^*$ is returned. Additionally, if a given time limit is reached, the procedure is stopped as well.

\section{Adaption to the MDCP}\label{sec:adaption-to-mdcp}
The MQCP and the MDCP can be approached very similar in the context of a local search based algorithm, as during the local search procedure in both cases we try to find neighboring solutions that maximize the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the current candidate solution. The objective value of a candidate solution as defined in \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} is equivalent in both problems. Thus, we only have to change the feasibility checks for feasible MQCs in Line~\ref{alg:feasibility-check-1} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:structure}, Line~\ref{alg:feasibility-check-2} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:extend}, and Line~\ref{alg:feasibility-check-3} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:local-search-procedure}, as well as the expansion into feasible successors in the lower bound heuristic in Line~\ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic-expansion} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic} to feasibility checks for MDCs. The proposed construction heuristic can be used for the MDCP without any change.  

\chapter{Using Graph Neural Networks in a Local Search Based Metaheuristic Edge-Based Relaxations of the Maximum Clique Problem}\label{chp:gnn}

In this chapter we extend our algorithm LSBM presented in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} by utilizing a GNN as a learnable scoring function in order to enhance the algorithm. 
Section \ref{sec:gnn-local-search} discusses the motivation of using a GNN within LSBM and points out weaknesses of current approaches that we hope to overcome. Moreover, we show the general structure of our training algorithm LSBM-T that can be used to train the GNN to predict, which vertices in the neighborhood relative to a candidate solution $S$ are more promising than others. 
In the following Sections we present in detail the components of LSBM-T. The definition of training samples is presented in Section \ref{sec:gnn-training}, and we explain how training data is generated.  
In Section \ref{sec:lookahead-search} we present our idea of using a look-ahead search that takes into account the current candidate solution and returns the best neighboring solution with respect to a user-defined neighborhood structure in order to obtain target values for training the GNN. 
Our proposed GNN architecture is shown in Section \ref{sec:gnn-architecture}. 
Finally, we analyze the effect of using a GNN as a scoring function on the runtime of the algorithm compared to using only $d_S$ as a scoring function in Section \ref{sec:performance}. 

Note that all the methods presented in this Chapter can be used both for the MQCP and the MDCP. Only LSBM itself has to be adapted as discussed previously in Section \ref{sec:adaption-to-mdcp}, but no changes have to be made in training data generation and during the look-ahead search, as the definition of objective value of a candidate solution and its neighbors coincides for both problems. 

\section{Using a GNN in Local Search for Maximum Clique Relaxation Problems}\label{sec:gnn-local-search}

In Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} we present a swap-based metaheuristic that evaluates possible swaps relative to a candidate solution $S$ by their respective gain $\Delta_{uv}$ for $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$ which is similar to current state-of-the-art heuristic solution approaches. 
Here, the function $d_S$ can be seen as a scoring function over the vertices in $V$. Vertices with higher scores in $V \setminus S$ and vertices with low scores in $S$ are promising candidates for swapping, as they maximize the gain of a swap $\Delta_{uv}$. 
Most local search based algorithms on the MQCP are based around this scoring function, as it is efficiently computable, and swaps with a positive $\Delta_{uv}$ directly increase the objective value, which is the density of the candidate solution. 
Using $d_S$ as a scoring function to evaluate the quality of swaps has two major drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In each iteration of the local search procedure, potential swaps are determined greedily: Only swaps that maximize the gain $\Delta_{uv}$ are considered. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, this corresponds to only searching the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$. It is possible however, that one or more swaps with low gain lead to an improved solution - for example, a local optimum $S$ with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$ is not necessarily a local optimum with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_5$, and in order to obtain an improving solution from $S$ with respect to $\Omega_5$, some swaps might have a negative gain when applied consecutively. 
    \item As shown in \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, in most iterations there are many possible swaps with the same gain, but not all of them lead to the same local optima. In order to decide between swaps with equivalent gain the authors therefore propose to use a more fine-grained secondary scoring function which serves as a tiebreaker. 
\end{itemize}

In order to address these drawbacks, we propose to incorporate the GNN into the local search algorithm to enhance the function $d_S$ as a scoring function for swaps: In each iteration of the local search algorithm, all vertices are evaluated by a GNN, assigning scores to vertices. The GNN can therefore be seen as a function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, where $\mathit{gnn}_S(v)$ denotes the score of vertex $v$ relative to candidate solution $S$. 
As with $d_S$, the scores returned by the GNN induce a ranking over the possible swaps: High scores for vertices in $V \setminus S$ and low scores for vertices in $S$ indicate that these vertices are more likely to lead to an improved solution when considered for swaps. 
Moreover, note that $\mathit{gnn}_S$ is not necessarily independent of $d_S$: The $d_S$-values of vertices can be used as features for the vertices in the graph. Thus, function $d_S$ can also be taken into consideration, but its information is enhanced by structural information obtained from the graph in order to overcome its drawbacks. 

The use of a GNN in the context of LSBM in this approach is two-fold: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to the use of $d_S$, the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ can be used to restrict the neighborhood to only promising neighboring candidate solutions that can be obtained by only considering swaps involving the $k^\prime$ vertices with the highest scores in $V \setminus S$ with the $k^\prime$ vertices with the lowest scores in $S$. 
    \item The GNN can be trained to determine scores not only based on the neighborhood $\Omega_1$, but also to look ahead more than a single swap. This way, it can be used to obtain higher quality solutions as it is not caught in the local optima of the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$.
\end{itemize}

Using a GNN however imposes some other challenges: 
Whereas the scoring function $d_S$ can be updated efficiently after a swap, incrementally updating the scores is generally not possible with a GNN, and obtaining scores therefore is less efficient using a GNN. 
Furthermore, the quality of the scores predicted by the GNN depends on several determining factors, most importantly on the quality of the training data and the obtained target values and the architecture of the GNN. 

We aim to tackle these challenges in Sections \ref{sec:gnn-training} and \ref{sec:lookahead-search} by showing how the GNN can be trained to make high quality predictions using principles from imitation learning and reinforcement learning, in \ref{sec:gnn-architecture} by proposing suitable efficient GNN architectures that can be used in practice, and in\ref{sec:performance} by analyzing the performance of the local search based metaheuristic with and without the GNN. 

\section{Training the GNN}\label{sec:gnn-training}

The general approach of the training algorithm LSBM-T is structured as depicted in Algorithm~\ref{alg:training}. A visualization of the algorithm structure is presented in the flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart-training-algorithm}. 
At the start, the GNN-based scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ is initialized randomly. Then, in each iteration of the training loop a random representative instance is generated on the fly and LSBM is started with a fixed time limit and a maximum number of restarts and - most importantly - with the scoring function $\mathit{gnn_S}$ that is used to restrict the neighborhood during the local search procedure instead of the scoring function $d_S$. The size of the restricted neighborhood during this local search is defined by input parameter $k^\prime$, which sets the maximum cardinality for the restricted candidate sets $X, Y$.

We adapt LSBM slightly to return a swap history $H$ in Line \ref{alg:training-swap-history} besides the best found solution $S^*$. This swap history is a simple vector-like data structure that contains an entry for each call to the local search procedure during the execution of LSBM. An entry consists of the candidate solution that is generated by the construction heuristic at the start of the local search procedure and a chronological list of pairs of vertices in the input graph that correspond to the vertices swapped during the local search procedure. This way, all information about the trajectory of the search can be restored. 
After the execution of LSBM has finished, $n_s$ encountered candidate solutions are sampled using this swap history. 
A look-ahead search is applied to compute the best neighboring solutions and a vector $t$ of target values for the vertices in $G$. From $G, S, t$, a training sample is created and added to the replay buffer $R$. For a detailed description of how target values for these samples are computed, we refer to Section and \ref{sec:lookahead-search} and Subsection \ref{subsec:target-values}, where we propose and discuss different methods to identify and compute improving neighboring solutions. 
At the end of each iteration of the training loop, the GNN is trained with data from the replay buffer, if it has reached at least half of its maximum fill capacity $\rho$. 
This process is repeated for $z$ iterations, until the GNN is sufficiently trained. 

Using the NN during training data generation is typical practice in reinforcement learning, where the NN is often improved by ``self-play''. 
We justify this algorithmic design choice by arguing about the trajectory of the search, i.e., the set of candidate solutions encountered during execution of the local search based metaheuristic with or without the GNN: using the GNN-based scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ during training data generation will generate samples that would appear naturally during the execution of LSBM at test time. In contrast, using only $d_S$ as a scoring function during training data generation, the trajectory of the search might differ greatly compared to the trajectory when using $\mathit{gnn}_S$ - especially for an initially untrained GNN, which might decrease the stability of training.

\subsection{Obtaining Target Values}\label{subsec:target-values}
As already mentioned, a training sample consists of a graph $G = (V,E)$, a candidate solution $S$, and a vector of target values $t$ containing target values for each vertex in $G$. Training is done in an imitation learning setting: In order to obtain target values for the vertices in $V$, we apply a look-ahead search to the candidate solution $S$ as described in Section \ref{sec:lookahead-search}, and the GNN is then trained to imitate this look-ahead search. 
The look-ahead search returns a set of $j$ neighboring solutions $Y = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_j\}$ such that $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_j \subset V$ and $|S| = |S_1| = |S_2| = \dots = |S_j|$. Furthermore, all sets in $Y$ returned by the look-ahead search are the best neighboring solutions with respect to $S$ with equal objective value $f(S) < f(S_1) = f(S_2) = \dots = f(S_j)$. Note that if $S$ is already a local optimum with respect to the neighborhood structure searched by the look-ahead search, then $Y$ might be empty. Targets for the vertices in $V$ are then given by a mapping $y \colon V \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ which is defined the following way: For each $S_i \in Y$, let $S_{i}^1 = S_i \setminus S$, $S_{i}^0 = S \setminus S_i$. In other words, $S_i^1$ contains all vertices in $S_i$ that are outside $S$, and $S_i^0$ contains all vertices inside $S$ that are not in $S_i$. For $v \in (\bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^1) \cup (S \setminus \bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^0)$ we define $y(v) = 1$, and for $u \in \bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^0$ we define $y(u) = 0 $. We demonstrate this mapping by a small example in Figure \ref{fig:target-values}.

    \caption[]{A training sample given by a graph $G$ with candidate solution $S$. Edges are omitted for the sake of clarity. The three best neighboring solutions of $S$ w.r.t. the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood structure can be obtained by applying one of the swaps $(u_1, v_1), (u_1, v_2), (u_2, v_2)$ (marked by dotted lines). Thus, the vertices $v_1, v_2$ and the vertices in $S \setminus \{u_1, u_2\}$ are labeled with 1, whereas all remaining vertices are labeled with 0. }
    \label{fig:target-values}
\end{figure}

As the target mapping $y$ maps the vertices to either 0 or 1, this method of training can be seen as a vertex level binary classification task. A vertex $v \in V \setminus S$ is labeled with 1, if there exists a vertex $u \in S$ with label 0 such that swapping $u, v$ leads to a candidate solution with improved objective value. 
In order to train the GNN we therefore propose to use the binary cross entropy\footnote{More precisely, we use Flux.jl's logitbinarycrossentropy function, which is mathematically equivalent, but more numerically stable} as a loss function, which is suitable for binary classification tasks:
\[
    \mathit{binarycrossentropy}(\hat{y}, y^\prime) = \mathit{mean}(-y^\prime \cdot \log(\hat{y} + \epsilon) - (1 - y^\prime) \cdot \log(1 - \hat{y} + \epsilon))    
\]
Here, $\hat{y}$ denotes a vector of size $|V|$ that contains predictions given by the GNN, $y^\prime$ denotes a vector containing the target values of vertices obtained as previously described using the mapping $y$, and $\epsilon$ denotes a small positive number that is included to avoid infinity. 

% Obtain target values: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Imitation learning: 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item first appraoch: search neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for best solution(s). vertices in these solutions have target value 1, others have target value 0
%         \item extend first approach to a larger neighborhood, e.g. $\Omega_2$ or $\Omega_3$
%         \item for small graphs: use MILP model (implement better performing formulation F3 or F4 from \cite{VeremyevPBP16})
%         \item try beam search look ahead search, which also partially searches a larger neighborhood
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Reinforcement learning:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Beam Search with fixed depth $l$ to find best neighboring solution starting from candidate solution $S$: each node of the beam search tree corresponds to a candidate solution that has a distance of $i$ swaps to initial solution, where $i$ is the level of the search tree.
%         \item expand each node of the beam search tree into successor nodes that can be obtained by performing a single swap. expand each node into $k$ children, using the $k$ most promising swaps according to the GNN. this way the GNN guides how the search space is explored
%         \item evaluate each node by performing a single iteration of the local search procedure (with a local search / tabu search that uses the GNN as a scoring function). the value of a node is determined as the best found solution by the local search procedure
%         \item on each level, keep $\beta$ most promising nodes
%         \item when maximum depth $l$ is reached, return the candidate solution(s) that have the highest value according to the local search procedure. these solutions are then used as the best neighboring solutions 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item If there is a single best neighboring solution, calculate training targets as described: 1 for vertices in best neighboring solution, 0 otherwise. As a refinement, use e.g. the 5 best neighboring solutions and calculate targets based on the objective value of each solution: e.g. 1 for nodes in the best solution, 0.8 for nodes in the second best solution, etc 
% \end{itemize}


\section{Look-Ahead Search}\label{sec:lookahead-search}

In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, we need to be able to identify the best neighboring solutions in a given neighborhood structure relative to the $S$. More specifically, we want to consider the neighborhood structure(s) $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ for different values of $d$. In this section, we propose different methods in order to search these neighborhood structures. 

\subsection{A simple approach: Searching $\Omega_1$}

As a first approach, we can define the look-ahead search as simply searching the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$ w.r.t. a candidate solution $S$, which can be done in time $O(n^2)$ by inspecting all possible swaps. Note that the optimization described in \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} using the restriction of possible swaps to vertices from $X \subseteq S, Y \subseteq V \setminus S$ can be applied in order to speed up the search. 
When $\mathit{gnn}_S$ is trained successfully to imitate this look-ahead search, it will serve the same purpose as the function $d_S$ in Chapter~\ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, as $d_S$ is used to efficiently search the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$. 

\subsection{Beyond $\Omega_1$: Exact Approaches}

In order to search the larger neighborhoods $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ for $d > 1$, we distinguish between exact approaches and heuristic approaches. 
In the remainder of this section, let $X_i \subseteq S, Y_i \subseteq V\setminus S$ be two sets of vertices of equal cardinality, and let $S^\prime = (S \setminus X_i) \cup Y_i$ be the neighboring solution of $S$ obtained by removing the vertices in $X_i$ from $S$ and adding the vertices in $Y_i$ to $S$. Let $\mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i) = |E(G[S^\prime])| - |E(G[S])|$ denote the gain of edges when comparing $S^\prime$ and $S$.   

\subsubsection{Enumerating all possible swaps}
As already stated in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, the neighborhood structure $\Omega_d$ contains $O(|V|^{2d})$ neighboring solutions and can be searched in time $O(|V|^{2d} \cdot T_d)$ by enumerating all possible swaps, where $T_d$ is the time needed for determining the objective value of a neighboring solution in $\Omega_d$. 
The $\mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i)$ of a swap of nodes $X_i = \{u_1, \dots, u_d\}, Y_i = \{v_1, \dots, v_d\}$ is calculated using $d_S$ the following way: 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gain}
    \mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i) = \sum_{u \in X_i} d_S(u) - \sum_{v \in Y_i} d_S(v) + |E(G[X_i])| + |E(G[Y_i])| - \sum_{u \in X_i} \sum_{v \in Y_i} e_{uv},
\end{equation}
where $e_{uv} = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E$, and $e_{uv} = 0$ otherwise. 
The above equation is a generalization of the calculation of $\Delta_{uv}$: When adding the vertices in $Y_i$ to the candidate solution $S$, we add $\sum_{u \in Y_i} d_S(u)$ edges between vertices in $Y_i$ and $S$, and $|E(G[Y_i])|$ edges between vertices in $Y_i$, from which we have to subtract $\sum_{u \in X_i} \sum_{v \in Y_i} e_{uv}$ edges between $X_i$ and $Y_i$, as the vertices from $X_i$ are removed from $S$. When removing the vertices in $X_i$ from $S$, we remove $\sum_{u \in X_i} d_S(u)$ edges, but the edges in $G[X_i]$ are counted twice, which is why we need to add the term $|E(G[Y_i])|$. Note that $T_d$ is in $O(d^2)$, as the number of summands in Equation \ref{eqn:gain} depends on $d$. 

We propose the following optimizations to speed up the search: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $X_j = \{u_1, \dots, u_d\} \subseteq S, Y_j = \{v_1, \dots, v_d\} \subseteq V \setminus S$ such that $d_S(u_i) \leq u$ for $1 \leq i \leq d, u \in S \setminus X_j, d_S(v) \geq v$ for $1 \leq i \leq d, v \in V \setminus (S \cup Y_j)$, so $X_j$ contains the $d$ vertices in $S$ with the lowest $d_S$-values, and $Y_j$ contains the $d$ vertices in $V\setminus S$ with the highest $d_S$-values.  
    Then, for any sets of vertices $X_i = \{u_1, \dots, u_d\} \subseteq S, Y_i = \{v_1, \dots, v_d\} \subseteq V \setminus S$ it must hold that $\mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i) \leq \sum_{v \in Y_j} d_S(v) - \sum_{u \in X_j} d_S(u) + 2 \cdot \binom{d}{2}$. If the upper bound on the right side of the inequality is less than or equal to zero, then $S$ is a local optimum with respect to $\Omega_d$, and it is not necessary to examine any of the neighboring solutions at all. 
    \item Similarly, we can derive a lower bound: Let $X_j, Y_j$ be as defined above. Then, $\mathit{gain_S}(X_j, Y_j)$ is clearly a lower bound for the maximum gain among all neighboring solutions of $S$. When calculating $\mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i)$ for arbitrary sets $X_i = \{u_1, \dots, u_d\} \subseteq S, Y_i = \{v_1, \dots, v_d\} \subseteq V \setminus S$, we can therefore check, whether $\sum_{u \in Y_i} d_S(u) - \sum_{v \in X_i} d_S(v) + 2 \cdot \binom{d}{2} < \mathit{gain_S}(X_j, Y_j)$. If this is the case, we can avoid the computation of $\mathit{gain_S}(X_i, Y_i)$. This reduces the time $T_d$ from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$ if the above condition is fulfilled. 
\end{itemize}
% $d_S(v_{\sigma_{\max}(1)}) \geq \dots \geq d_S(v_{\sigma_{\max}(n)}), d_S(v_{\sigma_{\min}(1)}) \leq \dots \leq d_S(v_{\sigma_{\min}(n)})$

In practice, preliminary experiments have shown that searching the neighborhood exhaustively by enumeration of all possible swaps as described above is computationally infeasible for $d \geq 3$ even for small graphs ($|V| \leq 250$), even when applying the described optimizations. 

\subsubsection{MILP Approach}

As an alternative approach, we present two MILP-formulations, which we adapted from the formulations presented in \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013} and in \cite{VeremyevPBP16}.
 
The first formulation is based on the formulation F1 from \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}:  
\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} w_{ij}  &\\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i \in V} x_i = k & \label{milp:size-constraint} \\
    & \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq k - d  &  \label{milp:branching-constraint}\\
     & w_{ij} \leq x_i & \forall i, j \in V, i < j\\
     & w_{ij} \leq x_j & \forall i, j \in V, i < j\\
     & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1 & \forall i, j \in V, i < j\\
    & w_{ij} \geq 0 & \forall i, j \in V, i < j \\
    & x_i \in \{0,1\} & i \in V
\end{align}

We change the objective function to determine the neighboring solution $S'$ of $S$ that can be obtained after at most $d$ swaps and maximizes the amount of edges in $G[S']$. The equality in \ref{milp:size-constraint} ensures that the neighboring solution contains $|S| = k$ vertices, and the inequality in \ref{milp:branching-constraint} ensures that $|S' \setminus S| \leq d$. 

Furthermore, note that this method has similarities to the idea from formulation F3 in \cite{VeremyevPBP16} presented in Section \ref{sec:mqcp-related-work}, where the variables $z_{\omega^\ell}, \dots, z_{\omega^u}$ are introduced that ``guess'' the size of the solution, which must be somewhere between the lower and upper bounds $\omega^\ell, \omega^u$. The formulation above can therefore be seen as fixing the vaiable $z_k = 1$ while setting $z_j = 0$ for $j \neq k$. Theoretically, this should speed up the search significantly, as the search space is reduced greatly by fixing the size $k$ of the solution.  

In practice, we obtain similar results as for the exhaustive search of $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$: Even for relatively small graphs ($|V| \leq 250$), this method becomes infeasible for $d \geq 3$. 

\subsection{Beyond $\Omega_1$: Heuristic Approaches}

In order to make training feasible on larger instances and for greater $d$, we propose heuristic approaches that approximate the best neighboring solution, trading solution quality for efficiency. 

\subsubsection{Restricting the neighborhood}

Recall that during the execution of LSBM we restrict the cardinality of the sets of vertices $X \subseteq S, Y \subseteq V \setminus S$ to the $k^\prime$ vertices with the lowest and highest $\mathit{gnn}_S$-values, respectively. Similarly, when searching $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$, we can restrict the cardinality of the sets of vertices considered for swaps $X, Y$ to contain up to $k^\prime$ vertices with the lowest and highest $\mathit{gnn}_S$-values each, and then exhaustively enumerate all possible neighboring solutions that can be obtained by removing up to $d$ vertices in $X$ from $S$ and adding up to $d$ vertices from $Y$. Intuitively, it makes sense to use a value $k^* > k^\prime$ for the size of the restricted neighborhood during the look-ahead search, as this means a greater part of the neighborhood structure $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ is searched and therefore the approximation is more likely to be precise. 
Furthermore, by using a fixed size neighborhood determined by $k^*$, the computation scales well on larger graphs. 
In order to make this training process more stable, we propose to start training with targets computed by searching a small neighborhood like $\Omega_1$ that can be searched exhaustively without restriction, and then changing to a restricted, bigger neighborhood. 

In order to make the training process more stable, introduce a user-defined parameter $\omega \in \mathbb{N}$ to the look-ahead search. This parameter dictates the number of iterations that the scoring function $d_S$ is used to restrict the neighborhood during the look-ahead search instead of the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, as the latter is initially untrained and thus unlikely to restrict the neighborhood to the most promising vertices. After the first $\omega$ iterations of the training loop in LSBM-T are completed, the look-ahead search then uses the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ to restrict the neighborhood. 

Furthermore, notice that the optimizations we proposed to exhaustively search the neighborhood $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ can also be applied to this neighborhood restricted by a GNN-based scoring function. 

% \subsubsection{A Beam Search Based Approach}

%  This method is based on Beam Search and its pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:lookahead-beam-search}.
%  We define a simple data structure for nodes in the beam search tree, where each node $v$ in the search tree corresponds to a set $S^\prime$ that can be obtained from the candidate solution $S$ by removing the vertices in $v.in \subseteq S$ from $S$ and adding the vertices in $v.out \subseteq V\setminus S$ to $S$. 
%  Typically, each node $v$ in the beam search tree is evaluated by an evaluation function $f(v) = g(v) + h(v)$, where $g(v)$ denotes the cost of $v$ and $h(v)$ denotes a heuristic value determined by the heuristic guidance function $h$. In Algorithm \ref{alg:lookahead-beam-search}, we define $g(v)$ to be the number of edges in the solution $S^\prime$ that corresponds to $v$, and we set $h(v) = 0$ for all nodes in the search tree. 

% In each iteration all nodes representing candidate solutions in the beam are expanded into child nodes the following way: Assume a candidate solution $S^\prime$ corresponds to a node $v$ in the search tree. This node $v$ is then expanded into up to $\varepsilon^2$ successor nodes that can be obtained by adding on of the $\varepsilon$ vertices with highest $d_{S^\prime}$-values in $(V \setminus S^\prime) \setminus v.\mathit{in}$ to $v.out$ and one of the $\varepsilon$ vertices with the lowest $d_{S^\prime}$ values in $S^\prime \setminus v.\mathit{out}$ to $v.in$. Note that the vertices in $v.in, v.out$ are excluded in order to avoid repeating candidate solutions. All expanded nodes are then evaluated by their $f$-values and the $\beta$ nodes with highest $f$-values become the new beam, whereas the remaining solutions are discarded. 

% Note that by the described expansion of the nodes into successor nodes, each level $i$ of the search tree only contains nodes that can be reached by performing exactly $i$ swaps from the root node which corresponds to the initial candidate solution $S$. 
% In order to avoid symmetries, i.e. performing the swaps $(u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2)$ produces the same candidate solution as performing the swaps $(u_1, v_2), (u_2, v_1)$, we use a hash map for each level of the search tree that stores the sets $v.\mathit{in}, v.\mathit{out}$ for each node. This way, when expanding a node $v$ into its successor nodes, we can check efficiently, whether a node with matching sets $v.\mathit{in}, v.\mathit{out}$ have already been added to $\mathit{children}$.  

% This process is continued, until a fixed depth $d$ is reached in the search tree. The candidate solution with the highest $f$-value is then returned. Note that this approach can easily be adapted to return multiple solutions if there are multiple best solutions with the same $f$-value.

\section{GNN Architecture}\label{sec:gnn-architecture}
In this section we present the key components of the GNN architecture used in our algorithm and justify our choices in designing said architecture. 
The whole process of evaluating a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a candidate solution $S$ is presented by means of a small example in Figure \ref{fig:gnn-architecture}. 
Initially, feature vectors $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are computed for all vertices in $V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, producing a feature matrix of dimension $\mathit{dim_{in}} \times |V|$, where $\mathit{dim_{in}}$ is the size of a feature vector. This feature matrix is used as input for the GNN based encoder, which consists of $l_e$ graph convolutional layers and outputs a node embedding matrix of dimension $\mathit{dim_{out}} \times |V|$. From these node embeddings, a context is computed by taking into account the current candidate solution $S$, and aggregating corresponding node embeddings by an aggregation function $\mathit{agg}$, generating a context embedding. The context embedding and the $d_S$-values for the vertices in $V$ are then concatenated to the node embeddings. The resulting matrix is used as input for the decoder, which can be realized as an MLP with a final layer $l_d$, which maps the values of the previous layer to a scalar output score by applying a sigmoid activation function. 

In the remaining Section we will discuss feature selection, the structure of the encoder and decoder, and the context embedding in detail. 

\begin{sidewaysfigure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/gnn-architecture.eps}
    \caption{Evaluation of a graph $G = (V, E)$ with candidate solution $S = {v_2, v_5}$ by the Encoder-Decoder based architecture. }
    \label{fig:gnn-architecture}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsection{Node Features}
Since the node embeddings are only computed once per graph, it is essential that the computed node features represent the vertices in a meaningful way by extracting similarities and differences of vertices and their surrounding neighborhoods. More precisely, high quality features should map vertices with similar neighborhoods closer together in the feature space, whereas vertices that are very distant from each other and do not share any structural similarities should be further apart. Moreover, it is essential that the chosen feature initialization method is generalizes well on unseen graphs, as the GNN used in our algorithm is trained offline on representative problem instances that differ from the instances encountered during execution. 

In \cite{Duong2019} the authors analyze the effect of different node feature initialization methods on node classification task. They distinguish between centrality based approaches (e.g. degree based initialization, number of triangles that a vertex participates in, etc), and learning-based approaches (e.g. DeepWalk \cite{Perozzi2014}, where vertices are mapped closer together, if the probability that they occur in a random walk together is higher). 
The authors conclude that centrality-based approaches are generally not as suitable as learning-based approaches by evaluating different feature initialization approaches in a node classification setting. 
We therefore investigate both the application of centrality-based and learning-based feature initialization methods. 

For centrality-based features, we evaluate \emph{Degree} initialization, where each vertex is initialized by its degree, and \emph{EgoNet} initialization: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, and vertex $v \in V$, let $N(v, d)$ be the set of vertices reachable from $v$ by a path of length at most $d$. The induced subgraph $G[N(v, d)]$ is the $d$-hop-EgoNet of vertex $v$. Note that for $d=1$, $N(v, d)$ is the closed neighborhood of $v$ in $G$. We derive three features from the EgoNet of each vertex in $V$: the size $|N(v, d)|$, the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the EgoNet $|E(G[N(v, d)])|$, and the number of edges that leave $N(v, d)$, i.e. ${\{u, v\} \mid u \in N(v,d), v \notin N(v,d), \{u,v\} \in E}$.     

Learning-based feature initialization models are mostly based on generating variations of random walks on the original graph or a derived graph, and then mapping vertices closer together in the feature space that often occur in these random walks together at a certain distance. Notable methods are \emph{DeepWalk} \cite{Perozzi2014}, its generalization \emph{Node2Vec} \cite{GroverL16} that introduces hyperparameters for the random walks, and \emph{Struct2Vec} \cite{FigueiredoRS17}. Whereas DeepWalk and Node2Vec take locality and distance between vertices into account, Struct2Vec is focused on structural similarities, i.e. vertices with structurally similar neighborhoods are mapped closer together, even though they can be at a great distance in the actual graph. We therefore propose to evaluate different parameterizations of Node2Vec and Struct2Vec in the context of our algorithm. 

\subsection{Encoder}
In general, any ConGNN model can be used as an encoder. In recent applications of GNNs in the context of COPs (e.g., \cite{Kool2019}, \cite{Joshi2021}, \cite{Hudson2021}) attention based GNNs seem especially promising, which is why we want to build our proposed GNN architecture on an attention-based encoder as well. 
In the following we denote by $\mathit{dim}_i$ the input dimension of layer $i, 0 \leq i \leq l_e$ of the network, where $l_e$ is the number of layers used in the encoder, $dim_0$ corresponds to the feature dimension of the node features, and for $1 \leq i \leq l_e$ $\mathit{dim}_i$ corresponds to the output dimension of layer $i$. 

% \subsubsection{Residual Gated Graph Convolutional Encoder}
% The update function of a Gated Graph Convolutional layer is defined in \cite{Bresson2017} as 
% \[
%     h_i^{l+1} = f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) = \text{ReLU} \Big( U^l h_i^l + \sum_{j \rightarrow i} \eta_{ij} \odot V^l h^l_j \Big),
% \]
% where $\eta_{ij} = \sigma(A^l h_i^l + B^l h_j^l)$. Here, $A^l, B^l, U^l, V^l$ are learnable parameter matrices and $\odot$ denotes the hadamard-product. 
% Furthermore, the authors define the Residual Gated Graph Convolutional layer by adding the identity operator: 
% \[
%     h_i^{l+1} = f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) + h_i^l
% \]
% The authors suggest that residual layers should be used on successive convolutional layers. 
% We add a batch normalization (\cite{IoffeS15}) layer after every GCN layer, which results in a final update function 

% \[
%     h_i^{l+1} = \text{BN} \Big( f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) + h_i^l \Big),
% \]
% where BN denotes batch normalization. 

% We therefore propose a ConvGNN model \textit{RG-GCN}, which makes use of these layers and is structured as follows: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Layer 0: We apply a learnable linear transformation with weight matrix $A_0$ and bias vector $b_0$, these weights are shared among all vertices. 
%     \item Layer 1: We apply a Gated Graph Convolutional layer that maps the feature vectors of dimension $dim_0$ to embeddings of dimension $dim_1$, followed by batch normalization.
%     \item Layers 2, \dots, $l_e$: For layer $i, 2 \leq i \leq l_e$ we apply a Residual Gated Graph Convolutional layer, followed by batch normalization, mapping inputs of dimension $dim_{i-1}$ to dimension $dim_i$. 
% \end{itemize}

The architecture of our encoder builds upon the work presented in \cite{Kool2019}, in which the authors use attention-based GNNs to solve the Euclidean 2D TSP. We use their encoder architecture in this proposed ConvGNN model and slightly adapt it to our purpose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Layer 1: We apply a linear transformation $A_1 x_i + b_1$ with learnable parameters $A_1, b_1$ for each feature vector $x_i, 1 \leq i \leq n$.
    \item Layers 2, \dots, $l_e$: Following the ConvGNN model used by \cite{Kool2019}, each attention layer consists of two sub-layers: A multi-head attention (MHA) layer and a dense, fully connected feed-forward (FF) layer. Each sub-layer also applies a skip-connection and batch-normalization. The following sub-layer definitions are given by the authors: 
    \begin{align*}
        \hat{h}_i &= \text{BN}^l(h_i^{(l-1)} + \text{MHA}_i^l (h_1^{(l-1)}, \dots , h_n^{(l-1)}) ) \\
        h_i^{(l)} &= \text{BN}^l(\hat{h}_i + FF^l(\hat{h}_i))
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
In \cite{Kool2019}, the authors use as the MHA layer an attention mechanism which is based on the transformer architecture in \cite{VaswaniSPUJGKP17}. We replace this layer by the newer GATv2 layer from \cite{Brody2021}, which was developed as an improved version of the Graph Attention Network \cite{Velickovic2018}. Here, a GATv2 attention layer is defined by the update function 
\[
    h_i^{(l)} = \sum_{j \in N_G[i]} \alpha_{ij} W_{1}^{(l)} h_j^{(l-1)}.    
\]
The attention coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are defined as 
\[
    \alpha_{ij} = \frac{1}{z_i} \exp(a^T \mathrm{LeakyReLU(W_2^{(l)}h_i^{(l-1)} + W_1 h_j^{(l-1)} )}),    
\]
where $z_i$ is a normalization factor and $a, W_1, W_2$ are learned layers. 

\subsection{Context}
The context is determined by the current candidate solution $S$ and is computed by aggregating the columns of the node embedding matrix that correspond to the vertices in $S$. In general, any order invariant aggregation function $\mathit{agg} \in \{\mathit{sum, mean, max}\}$ can be used, but similar in similar applications $\mathit{mean}$ seems to be the best choice, which is why we primarily use this aggregation function to compute the context. Furthermore, we derive features from the function $d_S$ (the $d_S$-values can of course be used, but also the mean and standard deviation of all $d_S$-values might be valuable information) and append them to the context embeddings, creating feature vectors $e_i \; || \; c_i$ for $v_i, 1 \leq i \leq |V|$ by concatenating the context and the node embeddings. These final embeddings are used as inputs for the decoder. 

\subsection{Decoder}
The decoder is a regression model that maps the inputs obtained from the node embeddings and the context embedding to scalar values representing scores for the vertices in $V$. We suggest using a simple MLP architecture with a sigmoid activation function on the final layer, mapping the results of the previous layers to scalar values between zero and one. 

As an addition to the node embeddings and the context embedding, the current $d_S$-values can also be used as decoder inputs. Furthermore, as the decoder evaluates each vertex independently, it might also be relevant to add information about the distribution of the $d_S$ values, e.g. mean and standard deviation. 

\section{Performance}\label{sec:performance}

Since the main difference between the algorithms presented in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} and \ref{chp:gnn} lies in the scoring function used to evaluate vertices during the swap based local search procedure, we want to analyze the effect of using the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ to restrict the neighborhoods instead of the scoring function $d_S$. Note that $d_S$ has to be used in LSBM, even when another scoring function is used to restrict the neighborhoods, as using the $d_S$-values is the most efficient way to keep track of the objective value of candidate solutions. Thus, we know that using the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ can never be faster than using $d_S$, alone, but we want to analyze, where possible bottlenecks can be found and how to keep the additional computational effort as low as possi8ble.  
In order to do so, we identify the three main operations during the local search procedure that are influenced by the choice of scoring function: Initialization, restricting neighborhoods, and updating the scoring function.  

\subsection{Initializing the scoring function $d_S$}

At the start of the local search procedure, a construction heuristic is used to produce a new candidate solution $S$, which serves as a starting point. 
The scoring function $d_S$ must then be initialized, as it is dependent on $S$. The initialization procedure can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:init-dS}.
It starts by initializing an array of zeros of size $n$. For each vertex $u \in S$, increase the value $d_S[v]$ by one for each neighbor $v$ of $u$. This procedure has a worst-time-complexity of $O(n^2)$ time, as the size of $S$ is in $O(n)$, and each vertex in $S$ can have $O(n)$ neighbors. 

\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwIn{Graph $G = (V,E)$, candidate solution $S$}
    \KwOut{Initialized scoring function $d_S$}
    $d_S \gets [0, \dots, 0]$ // Array of size $n$ \;
    \For{$u \in S$}{
        \For{$v \in N_G(u)$}{
            $d_S[v] \gets d_S[v] + 1$
        }
    }
    \Return{$d_S$}
    \caption{Initialize scoring function $d_S$}
    \label{alg:init-dS}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Initializing the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$}

When using the scoring function $gnn_S$, initializing the scoring function is done by computing node embeddings for each vertex in $G$. This is done by first computing node features and then computing node embeddings by passing the node features through a GNN based encoder. The time complexity of this initialization depends on the two parts. Firstly, the chosen node features have to be computed once per graph. This can be as simple as obtaining the node degrees, but can also be much more complex, when for example learning-based node features are used. Thus, initializing the node features takes feature specific time $O(T_{nf})$. Secondly, the convolutional operations defined by the layers of the GNN itself will take $O(n^2)$ time. The argument is similar as with $d_S$, as each vertex needs to be evaluated by taking into account all its neighboring vertices. 
Note that this initialization process has to be done only once per graph, thus it has a combined runtime of $O(T_{nf} + n^2)$. In subsequent restarts of the local search procedure, the node embeddings are already precomputed, and only the linear time decoder has to be applied. 

Since initialization is only done once per graph or once per restart of the local search procedure, the runtime should not have a great impact on the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, especially with a GNN based scoring function, this time should be used by utilizing an encoder of high enough complexity to produce high quality node embeddings. 

\subsection{Restricting the neighborhood using $d_S$}
When using the scoring function $d_S$, the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ is searched implicitly, as only swaps that maximize the gain are considered. 
The restricted candidate sets $X \subseteq S, Y \subseteq V \setminus S$ are generated in time $O(n)$, as only the minimum and maximum scores for vertices in $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively, have to be determined. As a reminder, the restricted candidate sets are defined as 
\[
    X = \{ u \mid u \in S, d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}, \\
    Y = \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \},
\]
with $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u), d_{\max} = \max_{v \in V \setminus S}$. 
If the swap $u \in S,v \in V \setminus S$ maximizes the gain of the candidate solution, this method of restricting the neighborhood guarantees that $u \in X, v \in Y$.
While this method produces restricted neighborhoods of variable size, these neighborhoods are usually small and thus can be searched efficiently in practice. In general however, the size of the sets $X, Y$ can be in $O(|V|)$ in the worst case. 

\subsection{Restricting the neighborhood using $\mathit{gnn}_S$}

Using the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, we do not have a guarantee that the swap that maximizes the gain lies among the lowest-scoring vertices in $S$ and the highest-scoring vertices in $V \setminus S$. Moreover, we might not even want to consider such a swap, as the scoring function was trained to search greater neighborhoods than $\Omega_1$, and the swap that maximizes the gain does not lead to the best neighboring solution. We therefore propose to use restricted candidate sets $X,Y$ of a fixed size $k^\prime$, where $X$ consists of the $k$ lowest-scoring vertices in $S$, and $Y$ consists of the $k^\prime$ highest-scoring vertices in $V \setminus S$. This guarantees that searching the neighborhood takes a fixed amount of time. 
Obtaining the $k^\prime$ highest or lowest scoring vertices can be done in time $O(k \cdot n)$, which is linear for fixed $k^\prime$, but is still more expensive than generating a restricted neighborhood for the scoring function $d_S$. As the restricted neighborhood is searched in every iteration of the local search procedure, its size can therefore also have a great impact on the runtime. It is therefore essential to determine a neighborhood size that strikes a good balance between efficiency and quality of neighboring solutions found in the neighborhood.  


\subsection{Updating the scoring function $d_S$}
After each swap of vertices $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$ the scoring function needs to be updated, as it is dependent on the current candidate solution $S$. For $d_S$, this update can be efficiently in $O(|V|)$ time by decrementing $d_S[x]$ for $x \in N_G(u)$ and incrementing $d_S[y]$ for $y \in N_G(v)$. All other vertices remain unaffected by a single swap and their corresponding $d_S$-values do not need to be updated. 

\subsection{Updating the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$}

For the scoring function $gnn_S$, we can generally not update the scores incrementally, as the context embedding changes, which is part of the input of all vertices. Therefore, all vertices need to be re-evaluated by the decoder. This still takes time linear in the number of vertices, but, depending on the complexity of the decoder, it can take considerably more time than updating $d_S$ after a swap. As this operation is done in every iteration of the local search procedure, it has a great impact on the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, the complexity of the decoder should be chosen such that it is as small and efficient as possible while still providing high quality predictions. 

\subsection{Conclusion}
When analyzing the performance aspect of the proposed scoring functions, it seems clear that a GNN based scoring function can in practice not be as fast and efficient as the scoring function $d_S$ alone. However, we want to address this weakness of our approach by keeping the NN - especially the decoder - as small and efficient as possible, by determining a neighborhood size that balances efficiency and solution quality, and by training the NN to provide a better guidance through the search space than $d_S$, leading to solutions of improved quality. Finally, in Table \ref{tab:runtime-analysis} we summarize the discussed worst-case time complexity of each of the three main operations.

% \section{Alternative Approach}
% \fxnote{delete this section or discuss it under future work?}
% A GNN could also be trained to predict which vertices are in an optimal solution. 
% Here we would need to obtain vertex labels by obtaining optimal or high quality solutions, and labeling the vertices in these solutions with one whereas remaining vertices are labeled with zero. The GNN is then trained on this data. 

% The GNN will then be applied only once at the beginning of the local search algorithm. The output of the GNN could be used as a secondary scoring function: When there are two or more swaps with the same gain, the swap that has a higher probability of adding a vertex from the optimal solution will be preferred. 


% \section{First Approach}
% This subsection documents the first attempts at testing GNN structures and different methods of training; it will be removed or reworked later.

% \paragraph{Collecting Training Data.} We start by trying an imitation learning approach on smaller graphs. Especially the following graphs in Table \ref{tab:first-approach} from the DIMACS benchmark set seem to have an appropriate size for a first approach. 
% These graphs can be grouped into three categories: two low density graphs ($0 < \mathrm{dens}(G) \leq 0.2$), three medium density graphs ($0.4 \leq \mathrm{dens}(G) \leq 0.6$), and five high density graphs ($0.75 \leq \mathrm{dens}(G)$). 

% As already discussed, a training sample consists of a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a candidate solution $S \subset V$. 
% As a first step, we collect a dataset of training samples from executing the metaheuristic local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}. Training samples are collected the following way: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Generate a random graph with a number of vertices sampled from a normal distribution with $\mu = 200, \sigma = 15$ - this ensures the size of the graph will be around 200 vertices
%     \item Generate uniformly sampled random edges, with uniformly sampled density depending on graph category: 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item low density: $\mathrm{dens}(G) \in (0, 0.2)$
%         \item medium density: $\mathrm{dens}(G) \in [0.4, 0.6]$
%         \item high density: $\mathrm{dens}(G) \in [0.75, 0.9]$
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Run the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} for 60 seconds and record all encountered candidate solutions. From all encountered candidate solutions, sample 100 to add to the dataset. 
% \end{itemize}
% This way, we collect $10,000$ training samples for each of the three categories: We generate 100 different graphs for each category, and collect 100 samples for each graph. 

% \paragraph{Training the GNN.} As a first approach, we try to imitate existing local search algorithms, which try to identify the best neighbor in the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood structure: Given a training sample $(G, S)$, where $G$ is a graph instance and $S \subset V$ a candidate solution, we first obtain the best neighboring solution $S^\prime \in \Omega_1$, which is defined as the best candidate solution (= with higher objective value, which is density for the MQCP) that can be obtained by swapping a single pair of vertices $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$. If there are multiple best neighboring solutions with equal objective value, ties are broken randomly. From this we can compute the target values for training the following way: For each vertex $v \in V$, we define the target value as $1$ if $u \in S^\prime$, and $0$ if $v \notin S^\prime$. 

% \paragraph{GNN Architecture.} We start with a simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). For each vertex $v \in V = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we define a feature vector 
% $x_v = 
% \begin{bmatrix} \mathrm{deg}(v) \\
%     d_S(v) 
% \end{bmatrix}$. 
% As a first approach, we simply use three Graph Convolutional Layers. As output, we obtain a scalar value for each input vector, which is the score of the vertex evaluated by the GNN. 

% \paragraph{Evaluating the approach.} 
% In principle, we can view training the network as a binary classification task for each vertex $v \in V$: The GNN should predict for each vertex, whether it is in the best neighboring solution $S^\prime$ or not. 
% In order to evaluate the effectivity of this training, we therefore propose the following: We do a $80/20$ training/validation split of the $10,000$ samples and train the network on $80\%$ of the data. Then, we evaluate each sample in the validation set the following way: The GNN is used to calculate the scores for vertices in the sample, and a swap is performed according to the scores returned by the GNN. If the resulting candidate solution has the same objective value as the (one of the) best solution(s) returned by exhaustively searching the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood, then the GNN has correctly identified the best neighboring solution, otherwise, the result is incorrect. As a first step, we will look how accurately the GNN identifies the (one of the) best neighboring solution(s). 

% Finally, if the accuracy of this approach reaches satisfactory results, we can try evaluating the approach on the benchmark instances, and compare the results to i) the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, and ii) the results from the literature.

\chapter{Computational Experiments \& Evaluation}\label{chp:evaluation}

We implemented LSBM and LSBM-T in Julia 1.8.2 using Flux \footnote{https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl} and GraphNeuralNetworks \footnote{https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl}\cite{Lucibello2021GNN} for the implementation of the GNN, and Word2Vec \footnote{https://github.com/JuliaText/Word2Vec.jl} for the implementation of Node2Vec and Struct2Vec. All computational experiments in this chapter are executed on an Intel Xeon E5-2640 processor with 2.40\,GHz. For training the NNs, we use a memory limit of 32GB, whereas for all other experiments a memory limit of 20GB is used. 

In this chapter we present the evaluation of the different components and parameter settings of LSBM and LSBM-T. The parameters of the algorithm itself are listed in Table \ref{tab:parameters-lsbm}, whereas training specific parameter settings are listed in Table \ref{tab:parameters-lsbm-t}. 
In Section \ref{sec:alg-params} we report experiments regarding the execution and components of LSBM. 
Section \ref{sec:train-params} shows our evaluation of parameters of LSBM-T. Here, we evaluate, how well the GNN is able to classify vertices with respect to a candidate solution on instances of different sizes and densities, and which training parameter settings lead to the best results. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on well-established sets of benchmark instances for the MQCP and the MDCP and report the results in Section \ref{sec:benchmark-results}.

\section{Evaluation of Algorithm Parameters}\label{sec:alg-params}
\fxnote{Maybe first evaluate training parameters, and afterwars algorithm specific parameters? }
In this Section we focus on evaluating the components or ideas that distinguish LSBM from similar existing algorithms, namely the lower bound heuristic, and the use of a restricted neighborhood of fixed size. Furthermore, we want to evaluate the effectivity of using different short term memory types (Tabu List \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}\cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, Configuration Checking \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}) that can be found in similar algorithms. The remaining components of LSBM build on the work of other authors, namely the idea of using a frequency-based construction heuristic as in \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021} and the general algorithm structure of \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, which is why we use the reported best found parameters for these components. 

\subsection{Lower Bound Heuristic}
The Beam Search based lower bound heuristic proposed in Section \ref{sec:lower-bound-heuristic} is a heuristic method that produces a feasible solution on its own. We presented three different heuristic guidance functions: \emph{Greedy Completion}, which has a complexity of $O(|S^*|n)$ per node of the beam search tree, where $|S^*|$ is the size of the best found solution, \emph{Feasible Neighbors}, which has a complexity of $O(n)$ per node, and \emph{Number of Edges}, which returns in $O(1)$ the density of the candidate solution represented by a node in the search tree and thus corresponds to a simple generalized greedy construction in the context of Beam Search. 

Our proposed Beam Search is controlled by two hyperparameters, namely the beam width $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ and the expansion control variable $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, which is the maximum number of successor nodes for each node in the search tree. Clearly, these two parameters control the breadth of the search tree and thus can be used to balance runtime and solution quality. 
As the lower bound heuristic is used to find a feasible solution quickly in the context of LSBM, we prioritize runtime over solution quality, as the main part of the computation within LSBM is done during local search. Nonetheless, we evaluate different hyperparameter settings for the different heuristic functions in order to obtain a good starting solution even with a low computational effort. 

In Figures \ref{fig:bs-heuristics-random-1}--\ref{fig:bs-heuristics-random-4} 
we show the obtained solution qualities and runtimes of the three heuristics on randomly generated instances of different sizes and densities. We generated 20 random graphs for each combination of $|V| \in \{500, 1000\}, \mathrm{dens}(G) \in \{0.75, 0.9\}$ and ran our beam search with MQCP parameter $\gamma=0.95$. 
As to be expected, \emph{Greedy Completion} outperforms the other heuristics in terms of solution quality, but due to its time complexity, it should only be used when smaller solutions are to be expected, as the time complexity per node of the search tree is dependent on the solution length when using this heuristic evaluation function. 
In comparison, the solution quality obtained when using \emph{Feasible Neighbors} is slightly lower, but especially when larger solution are expected, the speedup is significant.  
We can also see that the difference in runtime between \emph{Feasible Neighbors} and \emph{Number of Edges} is marginal, while the former produces better results in all tested hyperparameter settings. 
Table %\ref{tab:bs-heuristics-bhoslib} 
shows the results when evaluating instances of the BHOSLIB benchmark set, which are very similar to those obtained on random instances. 
We conclude that \emph{Greedy Completion} works well on instances where smaller solutions are expected, but on large instances with high densities and low $\gamma$ the much more efficient \emph{Feasible Neighbors} heuristic should be used.

\subsection{Lookahead Search Parameters}
See how well the gnn trained with lookahead depth 1, 2, 3 is able to perform on unseen training data. 

Check on samples of different size how close lookahead search with restricted neighborhood gets to actual best neighbor 

\subsection{Graph Densities}
In general: Low density graphs are not that interesting consider, as exact methods can be applied for very sparse graphs. 

Argue that Learning based features are not as useful when used on high density graphs

\subsection{GNN Parameters}
See how layer sizes, number of attention heads affect solution quality and runtime 

\section{Benchmark Results}\label{sec:benchmark-results}
Try selected benchmark instances that are not too large and not too dense and show best results. 
Ideally, use some of the BHOSLIB instances, as one model can be trained for a set of 5 instances. 

Train for DIMACS instances with fixed $|V|, \mathrm{dens}(G)$?

Maybe train some models for sparse instances and check the large sparse graphs.

\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Work}\label{chp:conclusions}

Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present an algorithmic training framework for mcp relaxations
    \item Fast lower bound heuristic
    \item Enhance scoring function $d_S$ by NN 
    \item Evaluate on instances of different sizes and densities
    \item Evaluate on benchmark instances
\end{itemize}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Replace $d_S$ completely by defining stronger context
    \item Evaluate other feature initialization method, especially ones more suitable for very dense graphs
    \item utilize GPU
    \item train specifically for specific instances
    \item adapt to other mcp relaxations
    \item split prediction between vertices inside / outside 
    \item investigate other approaches to include gnns into search 
\end{itemize}
