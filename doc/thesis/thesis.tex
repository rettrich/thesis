\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
In many Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), problem instances exhibit clearly defined internal structures that can be expressed as graphs. Here, a graph is a tuple $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and the set of edges $E \subseteq V \times V$ defines the relationships among vertices. While there are other methods to deal with inputs of variable size (Fully Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are Neural Networks tailored specifically to learn from structured input in the form of graphs, making them a valuable tool for Machine Learning (ML) tasks on data with graph-like structure.   

In recent years, GNNs have gained popularity in their application in the context of COPs. However, current end-to-end ML approaches are in most cases not competitive to state-of-the-art (meta-)heuristic solution approaches, and their application is limited to small instances, where exact algorithms are available. Nonetheless, GNNs show promise in their use in COPs, and there have been many successful applications over the last years, e.g. 
% \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, or
\cite{Oberweger2022}, where a Large Neighborhood Search is enhanced by a GNN that guides a destroy-operator, or \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, producing solutions that reach a solution quality of $99.5\%$ while being three orders of magnitude faster. 

The main motivation of this thesis is to further study the application of GNNs in the context of metaheuristics for COPs defined on graphs. We address the problems of current end-to-end approaches by using a GNN only as a component of a metaheuristic search procedure that should enhance the search for high quality solutions either by speeding up the search or by improving the quality of its final solutions. More specifically, we consider several relaxations of a COP defined on graphs, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP), that seem to be well-suited for our purpose. 

\section{Considered Problems}
The MCP is the problem of finding a fully connected subgraph -- a \textit{clique} -- of maximum size in a given graph. It is a fundamental problem in computer science, as its decision variant is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems \cite{Karp1972}. The MCP has several practical applications, e.g.,  in bioinformatics \cite{Dognin2010} and social network analysis \cite{Pattillo_network_analysis_2013}. However, for some real-world applications that require identifying dense subgraphs, the MCP is too strict a model. This leads to the introduction of several clique relaxations such as -- among others -- the Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) (introduced in \cite{Abello2002}, Definition \ref{def:mqcp}), the Maximum $k$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) (introduced in \cite{Yu2006}, Definition \ref{def:mdcp}), and the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (MPP) (introduced in \cite{Seidman1978}, Definition \ref{def:mpp}). 
As all of these problems are NP-hard optimization problems, it is practically often infeasible to obtain exact solutions for large instances. However, many real-world applications often require solutions for large graphs. Therefore, efficient heuristic methods are needed that produce high quality solutions in an acceptable amount of time. While the MCP has been studied well over the last decades, heuristic methods for MQCP, MDCP, and MPP are less abundant. It is therefore another motivation of this thesis to enrich the arsenal of heuristic methods for these relaxations of the MCP. 

\section{Outline of the Thesis}

\chapter{Considered Problems and Definitions}

In this chapter we want to provide all necessary definitions and notations used throughout this thesis. Section \ref{sec:notation} lists commonly used graph theoretic notations and definitions. Sections \ref{sec:mcp} -- \ref{sec:mpp} show definitions for the problems considered in this thesis, starting with the Maximum Clique Problem, from which all considered problems are derived. Additionally, we list notable properties of the considered problems that are relevant for developing well-performing algorithms for these problems. 

\section{Notation}\label{sec:notation}

Throughout this thesis, we use standard graph theory notation. 
We consider $G = (V, E)$ to be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V\}$. We use the terms vertex, vertices interchangeably when denoting elements of $V$ in a graph $G$, and we use the terms node, nodes when denoting elements of a search graph or search tree corresponding to a search algorithm, e.g. in beam search. If not stated otherwise, $n = |V|$ denotes the number of vertices in $G$, whereas $m = |E|$ denotes the number of edges. 
A graph $G$ is \emph{simple}, if it contains no self-loops (e.g.,  $\{v,v\} \in E$) or multiple edges between two vertices. In this thesis, we only consider unweighted, undirected, simple graphs, as all the considered problems are defined on such graphs. 
A graph $G' = (V', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (V,E)$ iff $V' \subseteq V$, $E' \subseteq E$, and $\{u,v\} \in E' \colon u,v \in V'$. Let $S \subseteq V$ be a set of vertices in $G$. The subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$, denoted as $G[S]$, is a graph with vertex set $S$ and edge set $E(S) = \{ \{u,v\} \mid \{u,v\} \in E, u,v \in S \}$. 
The \emph{diameter} of a graph $G$ is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices in $G$. 

A \emph{clique} is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $G[S]$ is fully connected, i.e., $|E(S)| = \frac{|S| \cdot (|S|-1)}{2}$. A fully connected graph on $n$ vertices is denoted as $K_n$. A clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-clique, and this convention is also applied to clique relaxation models: A $\gamma$-quasi clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique, an $s$-defective clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$s$-defective clique, etc. 

The density $\mathit{dens}(G)$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as the ratio of the number of edges $|E|$ to the number of edges in a fully-connected graph with $|V|$ vertices $\binom{|V|}{2}$. 
The density of a graph is therefore a rational number between zero and one. 

The open neighborhood of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G = (V,E)$, denoted as $N_G(v) = \{ w \mid v \in V, \{v,w\} \in E\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, whereas the closed neighborhood of $v$, denoted as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, and $v$ itself. 
If the graph $G$ is clear from context, we use $N(v)$ or $N[v]$ to denote the open and closed neighborhoods of $v$, respectively. 
The neighborhood of a set of vertices is defined similarly: For $S \subseteq V$, let $N_G(S) = \bigcup_{v \in S} N_G(v) \setminus S$ be the open neighborhood of $S$ in $G$, and let $N_G[S] = N_G(S) \cup S$ be the closed neighborhood of $S$ in $G$. 

The degree of a vertex $v$ in a simple graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as $\mathit{deg}(v) = |N_G(v)|$, which is the number of adjacent vertices for a vertex $v \in V$. Generalizing the concept of vertex degrees, for $S \subseteq V$, let $d_S(v) = |\{w \mid \{v,w\} \in E, w \in S\}|$ be the number of vertices in $S$ that are adjacent to $v \in V$. As can be seen, $\mathit{deg}(v) = d_V(v) $ for all $v \in V$. 


\section{The Maximum Clique Problem}\label{sec:mcp}

The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP, Definition \ref{def:mcp}) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science. Its decision variant was one of first problems that were shown to be NP-Complete \cite{Karp1972}, from which NP-hardness can be derived for the maximization variant. The MCP is a well-studied problem and has many real-world applications, e.g., in network analysis \cite{Fortunato09}, \cite{Palla2005}, bioinformatics \cite{Depolli2013}, \cite{BUTENKO20061}, circuit design \cite{LeckyMA89}, and telecommunication \cite{DouikSAA14}. 
Figure \ref{fig:maxclique} depicts a maximum clique in a graph.

    \label{fig:maxclique}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Maximum Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is the problem of finding clique of maximum size in $G$. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Relaxations of the MCP}

For some real-world applications, the MCP is too strict a model, as some applications require identifying large, dense subgraphs, but not necessarily fully connected subgraphs. 
Furthermore, it might be the case that acquiring real-world data is an error-prone process, thus requiring relaxations of the clique model tailored to the specific application. 
For these reasons, several relaxations of the maximum clique problem have been introduced: The Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem \cite{Abello2002} and the Maximum $s$-Defective Clique Problem \cite{Yu2006} are density based and edge based relaxations, respectively, where a solution $S$ is a set of vertices with density of at least $\gamma$, or has at most $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$. 
The Maximum $s$-plex Problem is a degree based relaxation \cite{Seidman1978}, where each vertex in a solution $S$ is required to have at least $|S| - s$ neighbors in $S$, and the Maximum $s$-club Problem \cite{Mokken1979} is a path-based relaxation, where the induced subgraph $G[S]$ must have a diameter of at most $s$. Other relaxations include $s$-blocks, $s$-bundles and $s$-cores \cite{Gschwind2015}, among others. 

\subsection{Properties of the MCP}

In graph theory, a property $P$ of a graph $G$ is \textit{hereditary} if $P$ also holds for all induced subgraphs of $G$ \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. It is easy to see that the property of a graph being a clique is hereditary, as each subset of a clique is a clique itself. Heredity is an important concept in the context of graph theory, as it allows the development of algorithms that exploit the structure of solutions exhibited by heredity, e.g. \cite{Trukhanov2013} and \cite{GSCHWIND2018131}.  

Furthermore, there exist negative results about the hardness of approximating the maximum clique in a graph in polynomial time: In \cite{Hastad1999} and \cite{Zuckerman2007} the authors show that there exists no fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the MCP, unless $\mathit{P} = \mathit{NP}$, meaning that for a real number $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique in a graph with a factor of at least $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. More importantly, these hardness results are trivially also valid for relaxations of the MCP. Considering the hardness of approximability of the MCP and its relaxations, it is evident that heuristic approaches are of great importance when tackling large real-world instances that cannot be solved optimally in practice. 

\section{The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem}\label{sec:mqcp}

The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (Definition \ref{def:mqcp}) is a density based relaxation of the MCP, which was first introduced by Abello et al. \cite{Abello2002}. Pattillo et al. show that for any $\gamma$ with $0 < \gamma < 1$, the problem is NP-complete in its decision variant \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mqcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1]$, the Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has an edge density of at least $\gamma$, or, in other words, $G[S]$ contains at least $\gamma \binom{|S|}{2}$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MQCP}
In contrast to cliques, the property of being a quasi-clique is not hereditary. Algorithms which build upon heredity can therefore not easily be adapted to the MQCP. However, as noted in \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}, quasi-cliques display a property which the authors call \textit{quasi-heredity}. A property $P$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is \textit{quasi-hereditary}, if there exists some $v \in V$ such that $G[V \setminus \{v\}]$ also has property $P$. Furthermore, the authors show that quasi-cliques are quasi-hereditary. Therefore, for a $\gamma$-quasi-clique of size $k$ there exists a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of size $1,2, \dots, k$ such that each $\gamma$-quasi clique is a strict subset of the next one. Most of the leading heuristic algorithms for the MQCP (e.g. \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}) build upon this important property by searching for a sequence of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of increasing size in order to approximate the maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph. 

\subsection{Preprocessing of MQCP Instances}

In \cite{Abello2002}, the authors introduce the notion of $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices in the context of preprocessing. A vertex $v$ is $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} if $v$ and all its neighbors have degree smaller than $\gamma k$. If a lower bound $k$ for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique is known, the authors propose to remove all edges incident to $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices from $G$ in preprocessing. This preprocessing rule might be used to speed up the search process by sparsifying the graph, but we note that this preprocessing rule does not necessarily preserve the existence of optimal solutions. We prove this claim by giving a counterexample in Figure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}, where the optimal solution cannot be obtained after applying said preprocessing rule.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Consider the graph $G$ given in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub1}. The considered MQCP instance is defined by $G$ consisting of a $K_3$ and a $K_7$ connected by an edge and $\gamma=0.5$. Since $G$ has a density $dens(G) = \frac{25}{45} \approx 0.56$, the maximum $0.5$-quasi clique in $G$ is $V$. Assume a lower bound of $k=6$ is known, therefore the two vertices on the left are $k\gamma$\emph{-peelable} and preprocessing would remove all edges incident to these vertices, as can be seen in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub2}. Therefore, the density of this preprocessed graph would be reduced to $\frac{22}{45} \approx 0.49$ and the optimal solution $V$ would not be preserved.}
    \label{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}
\end{figure}

\section{The Maximum Defective Clique Problem}\label{sec:mdcp}

The Maximum Defective Clique Problem (\ref{def:mdcp}) was first introduced in \cite{Yu2006} in the context of predicting protein-protein interactions. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum $s$-defective-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mdcp}
	Given a graph \\ 
    $G = (V,E)$ and integer $s$, the Maximum $s$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains at least $\binom{|S|}{2} - s$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MDCP}

Although the MQCP and the MDCP are similar relaxations of the MCP, there are some key differences between the problems. It can easily be seen that the property of being a $s$-defective clique is hereditary: If $S$ is an $s$-defective clique with at most $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$, the removal of a vertex $v \in S$ cannot ``introduce'' any new missing edges.  
However, for a fixed size $k$, the two problems become interreducible: 
Finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique with $\gamma = \frac{\binom{k}{2} - s}{\binom{k}{2}} $, and finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique, where $s = \binom{k}{2} - \lceil \gamma \binom{k}{2} \rceil$. 
When approximating the maximum $s$-defective clique in a graph $G$ by a series of $s$-defective cliques of increasing size, the problem can therefore be reduced to finding a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques and vice-versa.


\section{The Maximum k-plex Problem}\label{sec:mpp}

\todo{maximum k-plex problem}

\begin{definition}[Maximum $k$-plex Problem]
	\label{def:mpp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer $k$, the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (MPP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that each $v \in S$ is adjacent to at least $|S| - k$ vertices in $S$.

\section{Solution Approaches for the MQCP}
\subsection{Exact Approaches}\label{milp-mqcp}
Pattillo et al. \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013} propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation with a number of variables that is quadratic in the size of the vertex set $V$. 
It is derived from the following quadratic formulation, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ are binary decision variables representing the solution set $S \subseteq V$, and $a_{ij}$ represent elements of the adjacency matrix with $a_{ij}$ equal to one if $\{i,j\} \in E$ and zero otherwise: 

\fxnote{GR: MILPs schreibt man normalerweise so auf, dass die Zielfunktion und alle Funktionen linksbÃ¼ndig stehen, alle Quantoren rechtsbÃ¼ndig. Inequalities nicht in eine Zeile zusammenfassen (auÃer Domainangaben wie 0 <= x <= 10.)}
\begin{align}
    \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i & \\
    \text{s.t. } \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j & \geq \gamma \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n x_i x_j
\end{align}
The authors linearize the above quadratic formulation by introducing variables $w_{ij}$ defined as $w_{ij} = x_i x_j$: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n (\gamma - a_{ij}) w_{ij} \leq 0  
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & &

Jedenfalls sollte man sich aber auch mÃ¶glichst an die Literatur in den Bezeichnungen anlehnen. Das gilt dann auch fÃ¼r den Gesamttitel der Arbeit. }
In this chapter we present a local search based metaheuristic for relaxations of the MCP in detail, which is the algorithmic fundament of the GNN based algorithm in Chapter \ref{chp:gnn}
At first, we introduce the general structure of the algorithm without using GNNs in Section \ref{sec:algorithm-structure}. We present two types of construction heuristics that we use in our algorithm. The first one is used to efficiently obtain a feasible initial solution of high quality that can be used as a lower bound, whereas the second one does not necessarily yield a feasible solution, but is used to explore new regions of the search space not yet visited. In Section \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} we define the main move operator used in the local search procedure and define the corresponding neighborhood structures. Furthermore, we show in detail the local search procedure of our algorithm that utilizes said neighborhood structures. 

\section{Algorithm Structure} \label{sec:algorithm-structure}

As noted by Friden et al. \cite{Friden1989}, a solution for the MCP can be obtained by finding a series of $k$-cliques for increasing values of $k$. Based on this observation, Wu et al. \cite{WuH13} develop an adaptive multistart tabu search algorithm for the MCP that in each iteration searches for a clique of size $k$ using a tabu search procedure. If such a clique can be found, $k$ is increased and the algorithm is restarted. The largest clique found this way is returned as the solution. Djeddi et al. \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} show that this idea can be extended to the MQCP by following the same principle: The maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph is approximated by finding a series of $k$-$\gamma$-quasi cliques, where the tabu search is restarted with increased $k$ each time a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is found. This idea is applied successfully also in other state-of-the art algorithms for the MQCP, namely \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020} and \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, which is why we want to base the general structure of our algorithm on this idea as well. 

The pseudocode of the general structure of our local search algorithm is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure}.
$\mathit{InitialSolution}$ constructs a feasible initial solution. Its main purpose is to obtain a high quality lower bound to obtain a good starting value for $k$. The procedure is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}.

In line \ref{alg:structure-freq} a long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ is initialized, where $\mathit{Freq[i]}$ stores how many times each vertex is operated on for $i=1,\dots,n$. This memory is kept when the loop in lines \ref{alg:structure-while-start}--\ref{alg:structure-while-end} is repeated, but no feasible solution could be found. In $\mathit{ConstructionHeuristic}$, $\mathit{Freq}$ is used to produce a candidate solution that favors vertices that have not been considered yet. This way, new regions of the search space are explored. The idea of using this long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ in the construction heuristic to cover a larger area of the search space comes from \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}. We change their construction heuristic slightly by combining it with a GRASP procedure as described in Section~\ref{sec:construction-heuristic}. 

Once a candidate solution is obtained by a construction heuristic, it is then improved by the local search procedure in line \ref{alg:structure-construction}, which is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} along with the definition of the neighborhood structures. If the resulting solution $S$ is feasible, a simple search is performed in $\mathit{Extend}$ to check if the solution can be extended to a feasible solution of greater size as shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:extend}.
Furthermore, $k$ is increased, $\mathit{Freq}$ is reset, and the best-so-far found solution $S^*$ is updated. 
If the solution obtained by the local search procedure is not feasible, the while-loop is repeated until the stopping criterion is met, e.g., the time limit is reached.

\section{Lower Bound Heuristic}\label{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}

In this section we propose a beam search based heuristic that returns a feasible solution that can be used as a lower bound for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in the input graph. This lower bound is used to obtain a high starting value for $k$ in line \ref{alg:structure-lower-bound} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:structure}. 
The pseudocode of the beam search is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic}. 
In the following, note the textual distinction between \emph{nodes} in the search tree and \emph{vertices} in the input graph which is made for the sake of clarity. 

In beam search, a node $v$ of the search tree is in general evaluated by a function $f(v) = g(v) + h(v)$, where $g(v)$ is the cost of the solution corresponding to a node, and $h(v)$ is a heuristically determined value given by a guidance function. 
We use a simple data structure for nodes of the search tree where a node $v$ has fields $\mathit{v.S}$ containing a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique that this node represents, and $\mathit{v.h}$, which is the heuristically determined value of the node according to the used guidance function.
Additionally, we define the cost of a node $v$ as $g(v) = |v.S|$, which is the size of the feasible solution that this node represents.  
The root node of the beam search tree is then defined by an empty candidate set $\mathit{root.S}$ with $\mathit{root.g}=0, \mathit{root.h}=0$. 

The main loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}--\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end} expands all nodes in the current beam into all feasible successor nodes. 
Since a node $v$ represents set of vertices $\mathit{v.S}$ which is a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, successor nodes are generated by checking for each vertex $u \in V \setminus \mathit{v.S}$ whether $\mathit{v.S} \cup \{u\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique. 
These successor nodes are then added to a list $\mathit{children}$. 
In order to avoid symmetries, e.g. nodes $u,v$ representing the same solutions such that $u.S = v.S$, we use a hash map for each level of the search tree containing all solution vertex sets that were already added for expansion. Before adding a successor node $v$ to $\mathit{children}$, a check is performed to make sure that a node representing $v.S$ is not already in contained in $\mathit{children}$.  

Note that due to this expansion into successor nodes all the solutions corresponding to the nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, and thus the same $g$-value.  
Therefore, $g$-values can be ignored in the evaluation, and all nodes in $\mathit{children}$ are evaluated by a guidance function $h$, and the $\beta$ nodes with highest $h$-values form a new beam while the remaining nodes are discarded. 
Furthermore, since all the solutions corresponding to nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, a random node is selected to possibly update the best-so-far solution $S^*$ on each level.
Finally, when the beam becomes empty, the maximum cardinality solution is returned. 

We propose two different guidance functions for this beam search: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first one returns the solution size that is obtained by a simple greedy construction: Given a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$, greedily add the vertex $v = \arg \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$ if $S \cup \{v\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, where $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. 
    Ties are broken randomly. This greedy extension is repeated until the corresponding solution is maximal, i.e. no single vertex can extend the cardinality of the solution while maintaining feasibility. 
    The size of the solution obtained this way is then the return value of the guidance function. This greedy guidance function has a time complexity of $O(kn)$ per iteration, where $k$ is the solution size obtained by the greedy construction and $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. 
    \item The second guidance function takes a parameter $l$ and evaluates a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$ by calculating the sum of the $l$ vertices in $V \setminus S$ with the highest values for $d_S(u)$. This guidance function is designed to be more time-efficient than the previous one, as the computation is independent of the solution size.

\section{Construction Heuristic}\label{sec:construction-heuristic}

The construction heuristic in line \ref{alg:structure-construction} in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure} aims to return a set of nodes $S$ of fixed size $|S| = k$ that is promising to lead to new local optima when used as a starting point for the local search procedure. The candidate solution returned by this construction heuristic is not necessarily feasible. 
The construction heuristic includes a parameter $p \in [0,1]$ which controls the balance between choosing nodes that have not been explored yet and nodes that increase the objective value of the current candidate solution. This approach of balancing exploration and objective value is inspired by \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, where the authors use a similar strategy during construction. We combine the authors' idea with using a GRASP-like approach. The procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:exploration-construction}. 
At first, a starting node is selected by choosing a node with the lowest $Freq$-value, breaking ties randomly. In each iteration of the main while loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}-\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end}, with probability $p$ a node with the lowest $Freq$-value in $N_G(S)$ is added to the current candidate solution $S$. If $N_G(S)$ is empty, an arbitrary node with the lowest $Freq$ value from $V\setminus S$ is selected instead. 
With probability $1-p$ we perform an iteration of a GRASP-like randomized construction: The restricted candidate list $\mathit{RCL}$ is built by adding all nodes from $V \setminus S$ that fulfill the condition $d_S(u) \geq d_{\max} - \alpha(d_{\max} - d_{\min})$, where $d_S(u)$ denotes the number of neighbors in $S$ for a node $u \in V \setminus S$, and $d_{\max}, d_{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum values $d_S(u)$ over all nodes $u\in V \setminus S$. Here, the parameter $\alpha$ controls the balance between greediness and randomness in a GRASP-like manner: $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a greedy strategy, whereas $\alpha=1$ corresponds to a purely random strategy.

\section{Neighborhood Structure and Local Search} \label{sec:neighborhood-structure}

The neighborhood of a candidate solution $S$ is defined by a move operator that swaps a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$. The set of neighboring candidate solutions of $S$ with $|S| = k$ that can be obtained by a single swap move is therefore defined as $\Omega_1 = \{ S \setminus \{u\} \cup \{v\} \mid u \in S, v \in V \setminus S \}$ and has size $|\Omega_1| = k \cdot (|V|-k)$, which is in $O(|V|^2)$. Similarly, we define $\Omega_d$ for $d=1,2,3,\dots$ as the set of neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping $d$ nodes from $S$ with $d$ nodes from $V \setminus S$, obtaining a neighborhood of size $|\Omega_d| = \binom{k}{d} \cdot \binom{|V|-k}{d}$, which is in $O(|V|^{2d})$. 


The quality of a candidate solution depends on the considered problem. For the MQCP and the MDCP a candidate solution $S$ is of higher quality than a neighboring solution $S^\prime$ if $G[S]$ contains more edges than $G[S']$. Thus, we define the objective function $f \colon 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ for the local search for MQCP and MDCP as the function that maps a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ to the number of edges in the induced subgraph $G[S]$. Therefore, $S$ is better than $S^\prime$ if and only if $f(S) > f(S^\prime)$. 

Similar algorithms that use local search in order to improve a candidate solution (e.g.,  \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}) only search the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for improving solutions. As the size of this neighborhood is already quadratic in $|V|$, the authors of the mentioned algorithms restrict the neighborhood to promising moves. A scoring function is used to find promising nodes in $V \setminus S$ and in $S$ that can be used for swaps. This scoring function is in most cases defined as $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. This way, the change in the objective function value when swapping a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$ can efficiently be calculated by $\Delta_{uv} = d_S(v) - d_S(u) - e_{uv}$, where $e_{uv} = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E$ and $e_{uv} = 0$ otherwise. 
The scoring function $d_S$ is thus used to restrict the neighborhood $\Omega_1$. 
Let $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u)$ and $d_{\max} = \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$.
\fxnote{GR: Diese Definitionen stehen etwas formloser oben schon, besser nur einmal sauber oben definieren.} Furthermore, let $X = \{ u \mid u \in S, d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}$ and $Y = \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \}$. The neighborhood $\Omega_1$ of a candidate solution $S$ is then restricted to only those neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping a node $u \in X$ with a node $v \in Y$, as all node swaps that maximize $\Delta_{uv}$ are contained in this restricted neighborhood. 

The pseudocode for our local search procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:local-search-procedure}. 
In each iteration of the main while-loop the restricted candidate sets $X$ and $Y$ are created from the sets $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively. These sets are created as described before, with an additional restriction: To prevent cycling through the same candidate solutions over and over again, a short-term memory is used to further restrict the sets $X$ and $Y$. There are two main methods that can be found in the literature, which we want to evaluate in our algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a tabu list is used to prevent cycling. Each time a vertex is in or out of the solution, it is added to the tabu list for a fixed number of iterations. While a vertex is in the tabu list, it is blocked and cannot be used in swaps. In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, the authors use two tabu lists: One for moving vertices out of the candidate solution, and one for adding vertices to the candidate solution. In \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a single tabu list is used for both operations. 
    \item In \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, the authors use Configuration Checking. In its simplest form, once a vertex $v$ is moved out of the candidate Solution, it is blocked from being moved again until at least one neighbor of $v$ is moved. The authors refine this strategy by using a threshold for each node $v$ that starts with $threshold(v) = 1$ for all $v \in V$. Each time a vertex $v$ is moved into the candidate solution, $threshold(v)$ is increased by 1. When $v$ is moved out of the candidate solution, it is blocked from being moved again, until $threshold(v)$ of its neighbors have been moved. Additionally, if $threshold(v) > ub\_threshold$, where $ub\_threshold$ is a user-defined upper bound, then $threshold(v)$ is reset to 1. 
\end{itemize}
If no improving move is possible, or one of the sets $X, Y$ is empty, a swap of two randomly selected unblocked vertices is performed in order to diversify the current local optimum. Furthermore, we define as stopping criteria: If the best solution $S^*$ does not improve for a fixed amount of iterations $it$, the procedure is stopped and $S^*$ is returned. Additionally, if a given time limit is reached, the procedure is stopped as well.

\chapter{Using Graph Neural Networks in a Local Search Based Metaheuristic}\label{chp:gnn}

In this chapter we extend the local search based metaheuristic presented in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} by utilizing a GNN in order to enhance the algorithm. 
Section \ref{sec:gnn-local-search} presents our idea of utilizing a GNN in the previously described local search algorithm and the general structure of the training loop. 
Section \ref{sec:gnn-training} concerns the definition of training samples, and how training data is obtained. 
In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, in Section \ref{sec:lookahead-search} we present our idea of using a look-ahead search that takes into account the current candidate solution and returns the best neighboring solution. 
Finally, we discuss relevant GNN models and architectures in Section \ref{sec:gnn-architecture}.


\section{Using a GNN in Local Search}\label{sec:gnn-local-search}

In Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} we present a swap-based metaheuristic that evaluates possible swaps relative to a candidate solution $S$ by their respective gain $\Delta_{uv}$ for $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$ which is similar to current state-of-the-art heuristic solution approaches. 
Here, the function $d_S$ can be seen as a scoring function over the vertices in $V$. Vertices with higher scores in $V \setminus S$ and vertices with low scores in $S$ are promising, as they maximize the gain of a swap $\Delta_{uv}$. 
Most local search based algorithms on the MQCP are based around this scoring function, as it is efficiently computable, and swaps with a positive $\Delta_{uv}$ directly increase the objective value, which is the density of the candidate solution. 
Using $d_S$ as a scoring function to evaluate the quality of swaps has two major drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In each iteration of the local search procedure, potential swaps are determined greedily: Only swaps that maximize the gain $\Delta_{uv}$ are considered. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, this corresponds to only searching the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$. It is possible however, that one or more swaps with low gain lead to an improved solution - for example, a local optimum $S$ with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$ is not necessarily a local optimum with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_5$, and in order to obtain an improving solution from $S$ with respect to $\Omega_5$, some swaps must have a negative gain when applied consecutively. 
    \item As shown in \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, in most iterations there are many possible swaps with the same gain. The authors therefore propose to use a more fine-grained secondary scoring function which serves as a tiebreaker. 
\end{itemize}

In order to address these drawbacks, we propose to incorporate the GNN into the local search algorithm to replace the function $d_S$ as a scoring function for swaps: In each iteration of the local search algorithm, all vertices are evaluated by a GNN, assigning scores to vertices. The GNN can therefore be seen as a function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, where $\mathit{gnn}_S(v)$ denotes the score of vertex $v$ relative to candidate solution $S$. 
As with $d_S$, the scores returned by the GNN induce a ranking over the possible swaps: High scores for vertices in $V \setminus S$ and low scores for vertices in $S$ indicate that these vertices are more likely to lead to an improved solution when considered for swaps. 

The purpose of the GNN in this approach is two-fold: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to the use of $d_S$, the scoring function can be used to restrict the neighborhood to only promising solutions: 
    Let $\mathit{gnn}_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} \mathit{gnn}_S(u)$ and $\mathit{gnn}_{\max} = \max_{u \in V \setminus S} \mathit{gnn}_S(u)$. 
    The neighborhood structure can then be restricted to only those swaps that lie within a certain distance of the most promising swap: e.g. only consider swaps of the $k$ vertices with the highest scores in $V \setminus S$ with the $k$ vertices with the lowest scores in $S$. 
    \item The GNN can be trained to determine scores not only based on the neighborhood $\Omega_1$, but also to look ahead more than a single swap. This way, it can be used to obtain higher quality solutions as it is not caught in the local optima of the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$.
\end{itemize}

The general approach is structured as depicted in Algorithm~\ref{alg:training}. 
Starting with a naively initialized GNN, in each iteration of the training loop the local search algorithm is started with a fixed time limit. During random iterations of the local search algorithm, training samples are added to a replay buffer, where a training sample consists of the graph $G$ and the current candidate solution $S$. For a detailed description of how training data is obtained and how target values are computed, we refer to Sections \ref{sec:gnn-training} and \ref{sec:sec:lookahead-search}, respectively. 
Once the time limit of the local search procedure is reached, the GNN is trained with data from the replay buffer. 
This process is repeated for $z$ iterations, until the GNN is sufficiently trained.

\section{Training the GNN}\label{sec:gnn-training}
\todo{write section}
Generating training samples: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a training sample consists of i) graph ii) candidate solution
    \item run local search algorithm with GNN as scoring function for e.g. 60 seconds 
    \item record swap history of each repetition of local search procedure. when timelimit is reached, sample e.g. 100 random candidate solutions 
    \item calculate target values by one of the later proposed methods
\end{itemize}

Obtain target values: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Imitation learning: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item first appraoch: search neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for best solution(s). vertices in these solutions have target value 1, others have target value 0
        \item extend first approach to a larger neighborhood, e.g. $\Omega_2$ or $\Omega_3$
        \item for small graphs: use MILP model (implement better performing formulation F3 or F4 from \cite{VeremyevPBP16})
        \item try beam search look ahead search, which also partially searches a larger neighborhood
    \end{itemize}
    \item Reinforcement learning:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beam Search with fixed depth $l$ to find best neighboring solution starting from candidate solution $S$: each node of the beam search tree corresponds to a candidate solution that has a distance of $i$ swaps to initial solution, where $i$ is the level of the search tree.
        \item expand each node of the beam search tree into successor nodes that can be obtained by performing a single swap. expand each node into $k$ children, using the $k$ most promising swaps according to the GNN. this way the GNN guides how the search space is explored
        \item evaluate each node by performing a single iteration of the local search procedure (with a local search / tabu search that uses the GNN as a scoring function). the value of a node is determined as the best found solution by the local search procedure
        \item on each level, keep $\beta$ most promising nodes
        \item when maximum depth $l$ is reached, return the candidate solution(s) that have the highest value according to the local search procedure. these solutions are then used as the best neighboring solutions 
    \end{itemize}
    \item If there is a single best neighboring solution, calculate training targets as described: 1 for vertices in best neighboring solution, 0 otherwise. As a refinement, use e.g. the 5 best neighboring solutions and calculate targets based on the objective value of each solution: e.g. 1 for nodes in the best solution, 0.8 for nodes in the second best solution, etc 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First Approach}
\todo{Discuss in meeting on 24/08}
This subsection documents the first attempts at testing GNN structures and different methods of training; it will be removed or reworked later.

\paragraph{Collecting Training Data.} We start by trying an imitation learning approach on smaller graphs. Especially the following graphs in Table \ref{tab:first-approach} from the DIMACS benchmark set seem to have an appropriate size for a first approach. 
These graphs can be grouped into three categories: two low density graphs ($0 < \mathit{dens}(G) \leq 0.2$), three medium density graphs ($0.4 \leq \mathit{dens}(G) \leq 0.6$), and five high density graphs ($0.75 \leq \mathit{dens}(G)$). 

As already discussed, a training sample consists of a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a candidate solution $S \subset V$. 
As a first step, we collect a dataset of training samples from executing the metaheuristic local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}. Training samples are collected the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate a random graph with a number of vertices sampled from a normal distribution with $\mu = 200, \sigma = 15$ - this ensures the size of the graph will be around 200 vertices
    \item Generate uniformly sampled random edges, with uniformly sampled density depending on graph category: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item low density: $dens(G) \in (0, 0.2)$
        \item medium density: $dens(G) \in [0.4, 0.6]$
        \item high density: $dens(G) \in [0.75, 0.9]$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Run the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} for 60 seconds and record all encountered candidate solutions. From all encountered candidate solutions, sample 100 to add to the dataset. 
\end{itemize}
This way, we collect $10,000$ training samples for each of the three categories: We generate 100 different graphs for each category, and collect 100 samples for each graph. 

\paragraph{Training the GNN.} As a first approach, we try to imitate existing local search algorithms, which try to identify the best neighbor in the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood structure: Given a training sample $(G, S)$, where $G$ is a graph instance and $S \subset V$ a candidate solution, we first obtain the best neighboring solution $S^\prime \in \Omega_1$, which is defined as the best candidate solution (= with higher objective value, which is density for the MQCP) that can be obtained by swapping a single pair of vertices $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$. If there are multiple best neighboring solutions with equal objective value, ties are broken randomly. From this we can compute the target values for training the following way: For each vertex $v \in V$, we define the target value as $1$ if $u \in S^\prime$, and $0$ if $v \notin S^\prime$. 

\paragraph{GNN Architecture.} We start with a simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). For each vertex $v \in V = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we define a feature vector 
$x_v = 
\begin{bmatrix} deg(v) \\
    d_S(v) 
\end{bmatrix}$. 
As a first approach, we simply use three Graph Convolutional Layers. As output, we obtain a scalar value for each input vector, which is the score of the vertex evaluated by the GNN. 

\paragraph{Evaluating the approach.} 
In principle, we can view training the network as a binary classification task for each vertex $v \in V$: The GNN should predict for each vertex, whether it is in the best neighboring solution $S^\prime$ or not. 
In order to evaluate the effectivity of this training, we therefore propose the following: We do a $80/20$ training/validation split of the $10,000$ samples and train the network on $80\%$ of the data. Then, we evaluate each sample in the validation set the following way: The GNN is used to calculate the scores for vertices in the sample, and a swap is performed according to the scores returned by the GNN. If the resulting candidate solution has the same objective value as the (one of the) best solution(s) returned by exhaustively searching the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood, then the GNN has correctly identified the best neighboring solution, otherwise, the result is incorrect. As a first step, we will look how accurately the GNN identifies the (one of the) best neighboring solution(s). 

Finally, if the accuracy of this approach reaches satisfactory results, we can try evaluating the approach on the benchmark instances, and compare the results to i) the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, and ii) the results from the literature.

\section{Look-Ahead Search}\label{sec:lookahead-search}
\todo{Ã¼berarbeiten}

As previously stated, a training sample consists of a graph $G$ and a candidate solution $S$. 
In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, we need to be able to identify the best neighboring solutions in a given neighborhood structure relative to the $S$. 

To identify the best neighboring solution for a candidate solution $S$ in the neighborhood $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$, we propose two different methods. First, we propose a MILP formulation that is suited for small instances. 
It is based on the formulation in \ref{milp-mqcp}, but we change it to find the neighboring solution $S'$ that can be obtained after at most $d$ swaps and maximizes the amount of edges in $G[S']$: 
\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} w_{ij} \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i \in V} x_i = k \\
     & \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq k - d    
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & & 
\end{align}

Additionally, we propose a second method that approximates the best neighboring solution, trading solution quality with efficiency in order to make training possible on larger instances. This method is based on Beam Search and its pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:lookahead-beam-search}. We define a simple data structure for nodes in the beam search tree, where each node corresponds to a set $S'$ that can be obtained from the candidate solution $S$ by swapping the nodes in $node.in \subseteq S$ with the nodes in $node.out \subseteq V\setminus S$. Furthermore, $node.f$ denotes the objective value of a node, which is defined as the number of edges in the subgraph induced by $S'$. 
\fxnote{GR: Hier besser auch wieder $f$, $g$ und $h$ in der Ã¼blichen Bedeutung in einer heuristischen Suche verwenden, siehe BS vorne.}
In each iteration all nodes representing candidate solutions in the beam are expanded into child nodes the following way: Assume a candidate solution $S'$ corresponds to a node in the search tree. This candidate solution is then expanded into up to $\alpha^2$ candidate solutions that can be obtained by switching the $\alpha$ nodes with highest $d_{S'}$-values in $V \setminus S'$ with the nodes with the lowest $d_{S'}$ values in $S'$. All expanded nodes are then evaluated by their objective value and the best $\beta$ candidate solutions become the new beam, whereas the remaining solutions are discarded.
\fxnote{GR: Mich Ã¼berrascht hier, dass in einem Schritt gleich mehrere Knoten ausgetauscht werden, wird da der Suchbaum nicht gleich extrem breit? Ok, es steht hier, dass nur die Knoten mit den hÃ¶chsten $d_S$-Werten mit den Knoten mit den niedrigsten getauscht werden -- aber das definiert ja dann wiederum nur einen Nachfolger, auÃer es gibt Ties. Wie Ties behandelt werden mÃ¼sst man hier auch erklÃ¤ren. 
AustÃ¤usche von Knoten, die nicht die grÃ¶Ãten/kleinsten $d_S$-Werte haben werden gar nicht versucht? Ist das nicht eine ganz erhebliche EinschrÃ¤nkung?
Was ist hier weiters das Abbruchkriterium? Solche Swaps kÃ¶nnen ja beliebig lange fortgesetzt werden.
Weiters ist Symmetrievermeidung/reduzierung ein wichtiger Aspekt, d.h., das States, die auf unterschiedliche Art erzeugt werden kÃ¶nnen, nicht unnÃ¶tig mehrfach verfolgt werden. Z.B. Austausch x1 und x3, dann x2 und x4. Zuerst x2 und x4 tauschen, dann x1 und x3 fÃ¼hrt zur gleichen LÃ¶sung.}

\section{GNN Architecture}\label{sec:gnn-architecture}
\todo{Ã¼berarbeiten}
\begin{itemize}
    \item first try with GCN: use vertex degrees and $d_S$ values as features. this implicitly encodes the state (the candidate solution $S$) into the vertex features. 
    \item later: try GAT architecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Node Features}
Idea: For each node, do BFS with depth $d$ to calculate node features: Feature vector $x_i$ for node $v_i$ has at position $j=1,\dots,d$ the number of distinct nodes with distance $j$ from $v_i$. 
\fxnote{GR: Derartige Information sollten ja eigentlich $d$ GNN Layers von selbst finden kÃ¶nnen. Ich denke die grundlegende Information, die wir als Feature einspeisen mÃ¼ssen ist Information Ã¼ber den State, vor allem welche Knoten aktuell in $S$ sind und auch Freq, vielleicht auch die $d_S$-Werte.}

\fxnote{GR: FÃ¼r erste Versuche wÃ¼rde ich mal auf eine sehr einfache Netzstruktur setzen, vielleicht ein paar klassische GCN Layers (ohne Attention) gefolgt von softmax. 
Eine komplexere Encoder/Decoder-Struktur basierend z.B. auf GATv2 ist natÃ¼rlich interessanter und kÃ¶nnen wir dann, wenn der Ansatz mal grundsÃ¤tzlich funktioniert konkreter designen und testen.}
