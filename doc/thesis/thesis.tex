\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
In many Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), problem instances exhibit clearly defined internal structures that can be expressed as graphs. Here, a graph is a tuple $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and the set of edges $E \subseteq V \times V$ defines the relationships among vertices. While there are other methods to deal with inputs of variable size (Fully Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are Neural Networks tailored specifically to learn from structured input in the form of graphs, making them a valuable tool for Machine Learning (ML) tasks on data with graph-like structure.   

In recent years, GNNs have gained popularity in their application in the context of COPs. However, current end-to-end ML approaches are in most cases not competitive to state-of-the-art (meta-)heuristic solution approaches, and their application is limited to small instances, where exact algorithms are available. Nonetheless, GNNs show promise in their use in COPs, and there have been many successful applications over the last years, e.g. 
% \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, or
\cite{Oberweger2022}, where a Large Neighborhood Search is enhanced by a GNN that guides a destroy-operator, or \cite{NEURIPS2021_0db2e204}, where a GNN is used to find maximal Independent Sets by imitating a time-expensive Monte-Carlo Tree Search, producing solutions that reach a solution quality of $99.5\%$ while being three orders of magnitude faster. 

The main motivation of this thesis is to further study the application of GNNs in the context of metaheuristics for COPs defined on graphs. We address the problems of current end-to-end approaches by using a GNN only as a component of a metaheuristic search procedure that should enhance the search for high quality solutions either by speeding up the search or by improving the quality of its final solutions. More specifically, we consider several relaxations of a COP defined on graphs, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP), that seem to be well-suited for our purpose. 

\section{Considered Problems}
The MCP is the problem of finding a fully connected subgraph -- a \textit{clique} -- of maximum size in a given graph. It is a fundamental problem in computer science, as its decision variant is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems \cite{Karp1972}. The MCP has several practical applications, e.g.,  in bioinformatics \cite{Dognin2010} and social network analysis \cite{Pattillo_network_analysis_2013}. However, for some real-world applications that require identifying dense subgraphs, the MCP is too strict a model. This leads to the introduction of several clique relaxations such as -- among others -- the Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) (introduced in \cite{Abello2002}, Definition \ref{def:mqcp}), the Maximum $k$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) (introduced in \cite{Yu2006}, Definition \ref{def:mdcp}), and the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (MPP) (introduced in \cite{Seidman1978}, Definition \ref{def:mpp}). 
As all of these problems are NP-hard optimization problems, it is practically often infeasible to obtain exact solutions for large instances. However, many real-world applications often require solutions for large graphs. Therefore, efficient heuristic methods are needed that produce high quality solutions in an acceptable amount of time. While the MCP has been studied well over the last decades, heuristic methods for MQCP, MDCP, and MPP are less abundant. It is therefore another motivation of this thesis to enrich the arsenal of heuristic methods for these relaxations of the MCP. 

\section{Outline of the Thesis}

\chapter{Considered Problems and Definitions}

In this chapter we want to provide all necessary definitions and notations used throughout this thesis. Section \ref{sec:notation} lists commonly used graph theoretic notations and definitions. Sections \ref{sec:mcp} -- \ref{sec:mpp} show definitions for the problems considered in this thesis, starting with the Maximum Clique Problem, from which all considered problems are derived. Additionally, we list notable properties of the considered problems that are relevant for developing well-performing algorithms for these problems. 

\section{Notation}\label{sec:notation}

Throughout this thesis, we use standard graph theory notation. 
We consider $G = (V, E)$ to be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V\}$. We use the terms vertex, vertices when denoting elements of $V$ in a graph $G$, and we use the terms node, nodes when denoting elements of a search graph or search tree corresponding to a search algorithm, e.g. in beam search, or nodes in a graph neural network. This distinction helps to keep formulations precise when for instance an algorithm that uses an internal graph structure is applied to a graph input, or to distinguish between vertices of a graph and the corresponding nodes of a graph neural network. 
If not stated otherwise, $n = |V|$ denotes the number of vertices in $G$, whereas $m = |E|$ denotes the number of edges. 
For a graph $G$ we also use $V(G), E(G)$ do denote its vertex set and edge set, respectively. 
A graph $G$ is \emph{simple}, if it contains no self-loops (e.g.,  $\{v,v\} \in E$) or multiple edges between two vertices. In this thesis, we only consider unweighted, undirected, simple graphs, as all the considered problems are defined on such graphs. 
A graph $G' = (V', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (V,E)$ iff $V' \subseteq V$, $E' \subseteq E$, and $\{u,v\} \in E' \colon u,v \in V'$. Let $S \subseteq V$ be a set of vertices in $G$. The subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$, denoted as $G[S]$, is a graph with vertex set $S$ and edge set $E(S) = \{ \{u,v\} \mid \{u,v\} \in E, u,v \in S \}$. 
The \emph{diameter} of a graph $G$ is the length of the longest shortest path between any two vertices in $G$. 

A \emph{clique} is a set of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $G[S]$ is fully connected, i.e., $|E(S)| = \frac{|S| \cdot (|S|-1)}{2}$. A fully connected graph on $n$ vertices is denoted as $K_n$. A clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-clique, and this convention is also applied to clique relaxation models: A $\gamma$-quasi clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique, an $s$-defective clique of size $k$ is denoted as a $k$-$s$-defective clique, etc. 

The density $\mathit{dens}(G)$ of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as the ratio of the number of edges $|E|$ to the number of edges in a fully-connected graph with $|V|$ vertices $\binom{|V|}{2}$. 
The density of a graph is therefore a rational number between zero and one. 

The open neighborhood of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G = (V,E)$, denoted as $N_G(v) = \{ w \mid v \in V, \{v,w\} \in E\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, whereas the closed neighborhood of $v$, denoted as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $v$, and $v$ itself. 
If the graph $G$ is clear from context, we use $N(v)$ or $N[v]$ to denote the open and closed neighborhoods of $v$, respectively. 
The neighborhood of a set of vertices is defined similarly: For $S \subseteq V$, let $N_G(S) = \bigcup_{v \in S} N_G(v) \setminus S$ be the open neighborhood of $S$ in $G$, and let $N_G[S] = N_G(S) \cup S$ be the closed neighborhood of $S$ in $G$. 

The degree of a vertex $v$ in a simple graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as $\mathit{deg}(v) = |N_G(v)|$, which is the number of adjacent vertices for a vertex $v \in V$. Generalizing the concept of vertex degrees, for $S \subseteq V$, let $d_S(v) = |\{w \mid \{v,w\} \in E, w \in S\}|$ be the number of vertices in $S$ that are adjacent to $v \in V$. As can be seen, $\mathit{deg}(v) = d_V(v) $ for all $v \in V$. 


\section{The Maximum Clique Problem}\label{sec:mcp}

The Maximum Clique Problem (MCP, Definition \ref{def:mcp}) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science. Its decision variant was one of first problems that were shown to be NP-Complete \cite{Karp1972}, from which NP-hardness can be derived for the maximization variant. The MCP is a well-studied problem and has many real-world applications, e.g., in network analysis \cite{Fortunato09}, \cite{Palla2005}, bioinformatics \cite{Depolli2013}, \cite{BUTENKO20061}, circuit design \cite{LeckyMA89}, and telecommunication \cite{DouikSAA14}. 
Figure \ref{fig:maxclique} depicts a maximum clique in a graph.

    \label{fig:maxclique}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Maximum Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) is the problem of finding clique of maximum size in $G$. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Relaxations of the MCP}

For some real-world applications, the MCP is too strict a model, as some applications require identifying large, dense subgraphs, but not necessarily fully connected subgraphs. 
Furthermore, it might be the case that acquiring real-world data is an error-prone process, thus requiring relaxations of the clique model tailored to the specific application. 
For these reasons, several relaxations of the maximum clique problem have been introduced: The Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem \cite{Abello2002} and the Maximum $s$-Defective Clique Problem \cite{Yu2006} are density based and edge based relaxations, respectively, where a solution $S$ is a set of vertices with density of at least $\gamma$, or has at most $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$. 
The Maximum $s$-plex Problem is a degree based relaxation \cite{Seidman1978}, where each vertex in a solution $S$ is required to have at least $|S| - s$ neighbors in $S$, and the Maximum $s$-club Problem \cite{Mokken1979} is a path-based relaxation, where the induced subgraph $G[S]$ must have a diameter of at most $s$. Other relaxations include $s$-blocks, $s$-bundles and $s$-cores \cite{Gschwind2015}, among others. 

\subsection{Properties of the MCP}

In graph theory, a property $P$ of a graph $G$ is \textit{hereditary} if $P$ also holds for all induced subgraphs of $G$ \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. It is easy to see that the property of a graph being a clique is hereditary, as each subset of a clique is a clique itself. Heredity is an important concept in the context of graph theory, as it allows the development of algorithms that exploit the structure of solutions exhibited by heredity, e.g. \cite{Trukhanov2013} and \cite{GSCHWIND2018131}.  

Furthermore, there exist negative results about the hardness of approximating the maximum clique in a graph in polynomial time: In \cite{Hastad1999} and \cite{Zuckerman2007} the authors show that there exists no fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the MCP, unless $\mathit{P} = \mathit{NP}$, meaning that for a real number $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique in a graph with a factor of at least $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. More importantly, these hardness results are trivially also valid for relaxations of the MCP. Considering the hardness of approximability of the MCP and its relaxations, it is evident that heuristic approaches are of great importance when tackling large real-world instances that cannot be solved optimally in practice. 

\section{The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem}\label{sec:mqcp}

The Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (Definition \ref{def:mqcp}) is a density based relaxation of the MCP, which was first introduced by Abello et al. \cite{Abello2002}. Pattillo et al. show that for any $\gamma$ with $0 < \gamma < 1$, the problem is NP-complete in its decision variant \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mqcp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and $\gamma \in (0,1]$, the Maximum $\gamma$-Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has an edge density of at least $\gamma$, or, in other words, $G[S]$ contains at least $\gamma \binom{|S|}{2}$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MQCP}
In contrast to cliques, the property of being a quasi-clique is not hereditary. Algorithms which build upon heredity can therefore not easily be adapted to the MQCP. However, as noted in \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013}, quasi-cliques display a property which the authors call \textit{quasi-heredity}. A property $P$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is \textit{quasi-hereditary}, if there exists some $v \in V$ such that $G[V \setminus \{v\}]$ also has property $P$. Furthermore, the authors show that quasi-cliques are quasi-hereditary. Therefore, for a $\gamma$-quasi-clique of size $k$ there exists a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of size $1,2, \dots, k$ such that each $\gamma$-quasi clique is a strict subset of the next one. Most of the leading heuristic algorithms for the MQCP (e.g. \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}) build upon this important property by searching for a sequence of $\gamma$-quasi cliques of increasing size in order to approximate the maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph. 

\subsection{Preprocessing of MQCP Instances}

In \cite{Abello2002}, the authors introduce the notion of $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices in the context of preprocessing. A vertex $v$ is $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} if $v$ and all its neighbors have degree smaller than $\gamma k$. If a lower bound $k$ for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique is known, the authors propose to remove all edges incident to $\gamma k$\emph{-peelable} vertices from $G$ in preprocessing. This preprocessing rule might be used to speed up the search process by sparsifying the graph, but we note that this preprocessing rule does not necessarily preserve the existence of optimal solutions. We prove this claim by giving a counterexample in Figure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}, where the optimal solution cannot be obtained after applying said preprocessing rule.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Consider the graph $G$ given in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub1}. The considered MQCP instance is defined by $G$ consisting of a $K_3$ and a $K_7$ connected by an edge and $\gamma=0.5$. Since $G$ has a density $dens(G) = \frac{25}{45} \approx 0.56$, the maximum $0.5$-quasi clique in $G$ is $V$. Assume a lower bound of $k=6$ is known, therefore the two vertices on the left are $k\gamma$\emph{-peelable} and preprocessing would remove all edges incident to these vertices, as can be seen in Subfigure \ref{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-sub2}. Therefore, the density of this preprocessed graph would be reduced to $\frac{22}{45} \approx 0.49$ and the optimal solution $V$ would not be preserved.}
    \label{fig:preprocessing-mqcp-counterexample}
\end{figure}

\section{The Maximum Defective Clique Problem}\label{sec:mdcp}

The Maximum Defective Clique Problem (\ref{def:mdcp}) was first introduced in \cite{Yu2006} in the context of predicting protein-protein interactions. 

\begin{definition}[Maximum $s$-defective-Clique Problem]
	\label{def:mdcp}
	Given a graph \\ 
    $G = (V,E)$ and integer $s$, the Maximum $s$-defective Clique Problem (MDCP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains at least $\binom{|S|}{2} - s$ edges. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Properties of the MDCP}

Although the MQCP and the MDCP are similar relaxations of the MCP, there are some key differences between the problems. It can easily be seen that the property of being a $s$-defective clique is hereditary: If $S$ is an $s$-defective clique with at most $s$ edges missing in $G[S]$, the removal of a vertex $v \in S$ cannot ``introduce'' any new missing edges.  
However, for a fixed size $k$, the two problems become interreducible: 
Finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique with $\gamma = \frac{\binom{k}{2} - s}{\binom{k}{2}} $, and finding a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is equivalent to finding a $k$-$s$-defective clique, where $s = \binom{k}{2} - \lceil \gamma \binom{k}{2} \rceil$. 
When approximating the maximum $s$-defective clique in a graph $G$ by a series of $s$-defective cliques of increasing size, the problem can therefore be reduced to finding a series of $\gamma$-quasi cliques and vice-versa.


\section{The Maximum k-plex Problem}\label{sec:mpp}

\todo{maximum k-plex problem}

\begin{definition}[Maximum $k$-plex Problem]
	\label{def:mpp}
	Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer $k$, the Maximum $k$-plex Problem (MPP) is the problem of finding a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ of maximum size 
	such that each $v \in S$ is adjacent to at least $|S| - k$ vertices in $S$.

\section{Solution Approaches for the MQCP}
\subsection{Exact Approaches}\label{milp-mqcp}
Pattillo et al. \cite{pattillo_maximum_2013} propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation with a number of variables that is quadratic in the size of the vertex set $V$. 
It is derived from the following quadratic formulation, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ are binary decision variables representing the solution set $S \subseteq V$, and $a_{ij}$ represent elements of the adjacency matrix with $a_{ij}$ equal to one if $\{i,j\} \in E$ and zero otherwise: 

\fxnote{GR: MILPs schreibt man normalerweise so auf, dass die Zielfunktion und alle Funktionen linksbündig stehen, alle Quantoren rechtsbündig. Inequalities nicht in eine Zeile zusammenfassen (außer Domainangaben wie 0 <= x <= 10.)}
\begin{align}
    \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i & \\
    \text{s.t. } \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j & \geq \gamma \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n x_i x_j
\end{align}
The authors linearize the above quadratic formulation by introducing variables $w_{ij}$ defined as $w_{ij} = x_i x_j$: 

\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n (\gamma - a_{ij}) w_{ij} \leq 0  
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & &

\chapter{A Local Search Based Metaheuristic for Maximum Clique Relaxations}\label{chp:local-search-algorithm}

In this chapter we present a local search based metaheuristic for relaxations of the MCP in detail, which is the algorithmic fundament of the GNN based algorithm in Chapter \ref{chp:gnn}
At first, we introduce the general structure of the algorithm without using GNNs in Section \ref{sec:algorithm-structure}. We present two types of construction heuristics that we use in our algorithm. The first one is used to efficiently obtain a feasible initial solution of high quality that can be used as a lower bound, whereas the second one does not necessarily yield a feasible solution, but is used to explore new regions of the search space not yet visited. In Section \ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} we define the main move operator used in the local search procedure and define the corresponding neighborhood structures. Furthermore, we show in detail the local search procedure of our algorithm that utilizes said neighborhood structures. 

\section{Algorithm Structure} \label{sec:algorithm-structure}

As noted by Friden et al. \cite{Friden1989}, a solution for the MCP can be obtained by finding a series of $k$-cliques for increasing values of $k$. Based on this observation, Wu et al. \cite{WuH13} develop an adaptive multistart tabu search algorithm for the MCP that in each iteration searches for a clique of size $k$ using a tabu search procedure. If such a clique can be found, $k$ is increased and the algorithm is restarted. The largest clique found this way is returned as the solution. Djeddi et al. \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} show that this idea can be extended to the MQCP by following the same principle: The maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in a graph is approximated by finding a series of $k$-$\gamma$-quasi cliques, where the tabu search is restarted with increased $k$ each time a $k$-$\gamma$-quasi clique is found. This idea is applied successfully also in other state-of-the art algorithms for the MQCP, namely \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020} and \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, which is why we want to base the general structure of our algorithm on this idea as well. 

The pseudocode of the general structure of our local search algorithm is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure}.
$\mathit{InitialSolution}$, which is a generalized greedy search, constructs a feasible initial solution. Its main purpose is to obtain a high quality lower bound to obtain a good starting value for $k$. The procedure is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}.

In line \ref{alg:structure-freq} a long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ is initialized, where $\mathit{Freq[i]}$ stores how many times each vertex is operated on for $i=1,\dots,n$. This memory is kept when the loop in lines~\ref{alg:structure-while-start}--\ref{alg:structure-while-end} is repeated, but no feasible solution could be found. In $\mathit{ConstructionHeuristic}$, $\mathit{Freq}$ is used to produce a candidate solution that favors vertices that have not been considered yet. This way, new regions of the search space are explored. The idea of using this long-term memory $\mathit{Freq}$ in the construction heuristic to cover a larger area of the search space comes from \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}. We change their construction heuristic slightly by combining it with a GRASP procedure as described in Section~\ref{sec:construction-heuristic}. 

Once a candidate solution is obtained by a construction heuristic, it is then improved by the local search procedure in line~\ref{alg:structure-construction}, which is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:neighborhood-structure} along with the definition of the neighborhood structures. If the resulting solution $S$ is feasible, a simple search is performed in $\mathit{Extend}$ to check if the solution can be extended to a feasible solution of greater size as shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:extend}.
Furthermore, $k$ is increased, $\mathit{Freq}$ is reset, and the best-so-far found solution $S^*$ is updated. 
If the solution obtained by the local search procedure is not feasible, the while-loop is repeated until the stopping criterion is met, e.g., the time limit is reached.

\section{Lower Bound Heuristic}\label{sec:lower-bound-heuristic}

In this section we propose a beam search based heuristic that returns a feasible solution that can be used as a lower bound for the size of a maximum $\gamma$-quasi clique in the input graph. This lower bound is used to obtain a high starting value for $k$ in line~\ref{alg:structure-lower-bound} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:structure}. 
The pseudocode of the beam search is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lower-bound-heuristic}. 
In the following, note the textual distinction between \emph{nodes} in the search tree and \emph{vertices} in the input graph which is made for the sake of clarity. 

In beam search, a node $v$ of the search tree is in general evaluated by a function $f(v) = g(v) + h(v)$, where $g(v)$ is the cost of the solution corresponding to a node, and $h(v)$ is a heuristically determined value given by a guidance function. 
We use a simple data structure for nodes of the search tree where a node $v$ has fields $\mathit{v.S}$ containing a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique that this node represents, and $\mathit{v.h}$, which is the heuristically determined value of the node according to the used guidance function.
Additionally, we define the cost of a node $v$ as $g(v) = |v.S|$, which is the size of the feasible solution that this node represents.  
The root node of the beam search tree is then defined by an empty candidate set $\mathit{root.S}$ with $\mathit{root.g}=0, \mathit{root.h}=0$. 

The main loop in line~\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}--\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end} expands all nodes in the current beam into all feasible successor nodes. 
Since a node $v$ represents set of vertices $\mathit{v.S}$ which is a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, successor nodes are generated by checking for each vertex $u \in V \setminus \mathit{v.S}$ whether $\mathit{v.S} \cup \{u\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique. 
These successor nodes are then added to a list $\mathit{children}$. 
In order to avoid symmetries, e.g. nodes $u,v$ representing the same solutions such that $u.S = v.S$, we use a hash map for each level of the search tree containing all solution vertex sets that were already added for expansion. Before adding a successor node $v$ to $\mathit{children}$, a check is performed to make sure that a node representing $v.S$ is not already in contained in $\mathit{children}$.  

Note that due to this expansion into successor nodes all the solutions corresponding to the nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, and thus the same $g$-value.  
Therefore, $g$-values can be ignored in the evaluation, and all nodes in $\mathit{children}$ are evaluated by a guidance function $h$, and the $\beta$ nodes with highest $h$-values form a new beam while the remaining nodes are discarded. 
Furthermore, since all the solutions corresponding to nodes on a level of the search tree have the same cardinality, a random node is selected to possibly update the best-so-far solution $S^*$ on each level.
Finally, when the beam becomes empty, the maximum cardinality solution is returned. 

We propose two different guidance functions for this beam search: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first one returns the solution size that is obtained by a simple greedy construction: Given a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$, greedily add the vertex $v = \arg \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$ if $S \cup \{v\}$ is still a feasible $\gamma$-quasi clique, where $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. 
    Ties are broken randomly. This greedy extension is repeated until the corresponding solution is maximal, i.e. no single vertex can extend the cardinality of the solution while maintaining feasibility. 
    The size of the solution obtained this way is then the return value of the guidance function. This greedy guidance function has a time complexity of $O(kn)$ per iteration, where $k$ is the solution size obtained by the greedy construction and $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. 
    \item The second guidance function takes a parameter $l$ and evaluates a node $v$ with candidate set $S = v.S$ by calculating the sum of the $l$ vertices in $V \setminus S$ with the highest values for $d_S(u)$. This guidance function is designed to be more time-efficient than the previous one, as the computation is independent of the solution size.

\section{Construction Heuristic}\label{sec:construction-heuristic}

The construction heuristic in line \ref{alg:structure-construction} in Algorithm \ref{alg:structure} aims to return a set of nodes $S$ of fixed size $|S| = k$ that is promising to lead to new local optima when used as a starting point for the local search procedure. The candidate solution returned by this construction heuristic is not necessarily feasible. 
The construction heuristic includes a parameter $p \in [0,1]$ which controls the balance between choosing nodes that have not been explored yet and nodes that increase the objective value of the current candidate solution. This approach of balancing exploration and objective value is inspired by \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, where the authors use a similar strategy during construction. We combine the authors' idea with using a GRASP-like approach. The procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:exploration-construction}. 
At first, a starting node is selected by choosing a node with the lowest $Freq$-value, breaking ties randomly. In each iteration of the main while loop in line \ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-start}-\ref{alg:exploration-construction-while-end}, with probability $p$ a node with the lowest $Freq$-value in $N_G(S)$ is added to the current candidate solution $S$. If $N_G(S)$ is empty, an arbitrary node with the lowest $Freq$ value from $V\setminus S$ is selected instead. 
With probability $1-p$ we perform an iteration of a GRASP-like randomized construction: The restricted candidate list $\mathit{RCL}$ is built by adding all nodes from $V \setminus S$ that fulfill the condition $d_S(u) \geq d_{\max} - \alpha(d_{\max} - d_{\min})$, where $d_S(u)$ denotes the number of neighbors in $S$ for a node $u \in V \setminus S$, and $d_{\max}, d_{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum values $d_S(u)$ over all nodes $u\in V \setminus S$. Here, the parameter $\alpha$ controls the balance between greediness and randomness in a GRASP-like manner: $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a greedy strategy, whereas $\alpha=1$ corresponds to a purely random strategy.

\section{Neighborhood Structure and Local Search} \label{sec:neighborhood-structure}

The neighborhood of a candidate solution $S$ is defined by a move operator that swaps a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$. The set of neighboring candidate solutions of $S$ with $|S| = k$ that can be obtained by a single swap move is therefore defined as $\Omega_1 = \{ S \setminus \{u\} \cup \{v\} \mid u \in S, v \in V \setminus S \}$ and has size $|\Omega_1| = k \cdot (|V|-k)$, which is in $O(|V|^2)$. Similarly, we define $\Omega_d$ for $d=1,2,3,\dots$ as the set of neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping $d$ nodes from $S$ with $d$ nodes from $V \setminus S$, obtaining a neighborhood of size $|\Omega_d| = \binom{k}{d} \cdot \binom{|V|-k}{d}$, which is in $O(|V|^{2d})$. 


The quality of a candidate solution depends on the considered problem. For the MQCP and the MDCP a candidate solution $S$ is of higher quality than a neighboring solution $S^\prime$ if $G[S]$ contains more edges than $G[S']$. Thus, we define the objective function $f \colon 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ for the local search for MQCP and MDCP as the function that maps a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ to the number of edges in the induced subgraph $G[S]$. Therefore, $S$ is better than $S^\prime$ if and only if $f(S) > f(S^\prime)$. 

Similar algorithms that use local search in order to improve a candidate solution (e.g.,  \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}) only search the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for improving solutions. As the size of this neighborhood is already quadratic in $|V|$, the authors of the mentioned algorithms restrict the neighborhood to promising moves. A scoring function is used to find promising nodes in $V \setminus S$ and in $S$ that can be used for swaps. This scoring function is in most cases defined as $d_S(u) = |\{v \mid v \in S, \{u,v\} \in E \}|$. This way, the change in the objective function value when swapping a node $u \in S$ with a node $v \in V \setminus S$ can efficiently be calculated by $\Delta_{uv} = d_S(v) - d_S(u) - e_{uv}$, where $e_{uv} = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E$ and $e_{uv} = 0$ otherwise. 
The scoring function $d_S$ is thus used to restrict the neighborhood $\Omega_1$. 
Let $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u)$ and $d_{\max} = \max_{u \in V \setminus S} d_S(u)$.
Furthermore, let $X = \{ u \mid u \in S, d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}$ and $Y = \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \}$. The neighborhood $\Omega_1$ of a candidate solution $S$ is then restricted to only those neighboring solutions that can be obtained by swapping a node $u \in X$ with a node $v \in Y$, as all node swaps that maximize $\Delta_{uv}$ are contained in this restricted neighborhood. 

The pseudocode for our local search procedure is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:local-search-procedure}. 
In each iteration of the main while-loop the restricted candidate sets $X$ and $Y$ are created from the sets $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively. These sets are created as described before, with an additional restriction: To prevent cycling through the same candidate solutions over and over again, a short-term memory is used to further restrict the sets $X$ and $Y$. There are two main methods that can be found in the literature, which we want to evaluate in our algorithm: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019} and \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a tabu list is used to prevent cycling. Each time a vertex is in or out of the solution, it is added to the tabu list for a fixed number of iterations. While a vertex is in the tabu list, it is blocked and cannot be used in swaps. In \cite{djeddi_extension_2019}, the authors use two tabu lists: One for moving vertices out of the candidate solution, and one for adding vertices to the candidate solution. In \cite{zhou_opposition-based_2020}, a single tabu list is used for both operations. 
    \item In \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, the authors use Configuration Checking. In its simplest form, once a vertex $v$ is moved out of the candidate Solution, it is blocked from being moved again until at least one neighbor of $v$ is moved. The authors refine this strategy by using a threshold for each node $v$ that starts with $threshold(v) = 1$ for all $v \in V$. Each time a vertex $v$ is moved into the candidate solution, $threshold(v)$ is increased by 1. When $v$ is moved out of the candidate solution, it is blocked from being moved again, until $threshold(v)$ of its neighbors have been moved. Additionally, if $threshold(v) > ub\_threshold$, where $ub\_threshold$ is a user-defined upper bound, then $threshold(v)$ is reset to 1. 
\end{itemize}
If no improving move is possible, or one of the sets $X, Y$ is empty, a swap of two randomly selected unblocked vertices is performed in order to diversify the current local optimum. Furthermore, we define as stopping criteria: If the best solution $S^*$ does not improve for a fixed amount of iterations $it$, the procedure is stopped and $S^*$ is returned. Additionally, if a given time limit is reached, the procedure is stopped as well.

\chapter{Using Graph Neural Networks in a Local Search Based Metaheuristic for Maximum Clique Relaxation Problems}\label{chp:gnn}

In this chapter we extend the local search based metaheuristic presented in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} by utilizing a GNN in order to enhance the algorithm. 
Section \ref{sec:gnn-local-search} presents our idea of utilizing a GNN in the previously described local search algorithm and the general structure of the training loop. 
Section \ref{sec:gnn-training} concerns the definition of training samples, and how training data is obtained. 
In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, in Section \ref{sec:lookahead-search} we present our idea of using a look-ahead search that takes into account the current candidate solution and returns the best neighboring solution. 
We discuss relevant GNN models and architectures in Section \ref{sec:gnn-architecture}. 
Finally, we analyze the effect of using a GNN as a scoring function on the runtime of the algorithm compared to the scoring function $d_S$ in Section \ref{sec:performance}. 


\section{Using a GNN in Local Search for Maximum Clique Relaxation Problems}\label{sec:gnn-local-search}

In Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} we present a swap-based metaheuristic that evaluates possible swaps relative to a candidate solution $S$ by their respective gain $\Delta_{uv}$ for $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$ which is similar to current state-of-the-art heuristic solution approaches. 
Here, the function $d_S$ can be seen as a scoring function over the vertices in $V$. Vertices with higher scores in $V \setminus S$ and vertices with low scores in $S$ are promising, as they maximize the gain of a swap $\Delta_{uv}$. 
Most local search based algorithms on the MQCP are based around this scoring function, as it is efficiently computable, and swaps with a positive $\Delta_{uv}$ directly increase the objective value, which is the density of the candidate solution. 
Using $d_S$ as a scoring function to evaluate the quality of swaps has two major drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In each iteration of the local search procedure, potential swaps are determined greedily: Only swaps that maximize the gain $\Delta_{uv}$ are considered. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, this corresponds to only searching the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$. It is possible however, that one or more swaps with low gain lead to an improved solution - for example, a local optimum $S$ with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$ is not necessarily a local optimum with respect to the neighborhood structure $\Omega_5$, and in order to obtain an improving solution from $S$ with respect to $\Omega_5$, some swaps might have a negative gain when applied consecutively. 
    \item As shown in \cite{chen_nuqclq_2021}, in most iterations there are many possible swaps with the same gain, but not all of them lead to the same local optima. In order to decide between swaps with equivalent gain the authors therefore propose to use a more fine-grained secondary scoring function which serves as a tiebreaker. 
\end{itemize}

In order to address these drawbacks, we propose to incorporate the GNN into the local search algorithm to replace the function $d_S$ as a scoring function for swaps: In each iteration of the local search algorithm, all vertices are evaluated by a GNN, assigning scores to vertices. The GNN can therefore be seen as a function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, where $\mathit{gnn}_S(v)$ denotes the score of vertex $v$ relative to candidate solution $S$. 
As with $d_S$, the scores returned by the GNN induce a ranking over the possible swaps: High scores for vertices in $V \setminus S$ and low scores for vertices in $S$ indicate that these vertices are more likely to lead to an improved solution when considered for swaps. 

The purpose of the GNN in this approach is two-fold: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to the use of $d_S$, the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ can be used to restrict the neighborhood to only promising neighboring candidate solutions that can be obtained by only considering swaps involving the $k$ vertices with the highest scores in $V \setminus S$ with the $k$ vertices with the lowest scores in $S$. 
    \item The GNN can be trained to determine scores not only based on the neighborhood $\Omega_1$, but also to look ahead more than a single swap. This way, it can be used to obtain higher quality solutions as it is not caught in the local optima of the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$.
\end{itemize}

Using a GNN however imposes some other challenges: 
Whereas the scoring function $d_S$ can be updated efficiently after a swap, incrementally updating the scores is generally not possible with a GNN, and obtaining scores therefore is less efficient using a GNN. 
Furthermore, the quality of the scores predicted by the GNN depends on several determining factors, most importantly on the quality of the training data and the obtained target values and the architecture of the GNN. 

We aim to tackle these challenges in Sections \ref{sec:gnn-training} and \ref{sec:lookahead-search} by showing how the GNN can be trained in an imitation learning setting to make high quality predictions, in \ref{sec:performance} by analyzing the performance of the local search based metaheuristic with and without the GNN, and in and \ref{sec:gnn-architecture} by proposing suitable efficient GNN architectures that can be used in practice. 

\section{Training the GNN}\label{sec:gnn-training}

The general approach of the training algorithm is structured as depicted in Algorithm~\ref{alg:training}. A visualization of the algorithm structure is presented in the flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart-training-algorithm}. 
Starting with a naively initialized GNN, in each iteration of the training loop a random representative instance is generated on the fly and the local search algorithm is started with a fixed time limit. The local search algorithm is almost identical to the algorithm described in Chapter~\ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, with the key difference that the GNN is used as a scoring function in order to restrict the neighborhood during search instead of the function $d_S$. 
During random iterations of the local search algorithm, training samples are added to a replay buffer, where a training sample consists of the graph $G$ and the current candidate solution $S$. For each training sample, a look-ahead search is applied in order to identify which vertices lead to improving solutions when considered for swaps. For a detailed description of how target values for these samples are computed, we refer to Subsection \ref{subsec:target-values} Section and \ref{sec:lookahead-search}, where we propose and discuss different methods to identify improving neighboring solutions. 
Once the time limit of the local search procedure is reached, the GNN is trained with data from the replay buffer. 
This process is repeated for $z$ iterations, until the GNN is sufficiently trained.

\subsection{Obtaining Target Values}\label{subsec:target-values}
As already mentioned, a training sample consists of a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a candidate solution $S$. Training is done in an imitation learning setting: In order to obtain target values for the vertices in $V$, we apply a look-ahead search to the candidate solution $S$ as described in Section \ref{sec:lookahead-search}, and the GNN is then trained to imitate this look-ahead search. 
The look-ahead search returns a set of neighboring solutions $Y = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k\}$ such that $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k \subset V$ and $|S| = |S_1| = |S_2| = \dots = |S_k|$. Furthermore, all sets in $Y$ returned by the look-ahead search are the best neighboring solutions with respect to $S$ with equal objective value $f(S) < f(S_1) = f(S_2) = \dots = f(S_k)$. Note that if $S$ is already a local optimum with respect to the neighborhood structure searched by the look-ahead search, then $Y$ might be empty. Target values for the vertices in $V$ are then given by a mapping $y \colon V \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ which is defined the following way: For each $S_i \in Y$, let $S_{i}^1 = S_i \setminus S$, and let $S_{i}^0 = S \setminus S_i$. In other words, $S_i^1$ contains all vertices in $S_i$ that are outside $S$, and $S_i^0$ contains all vertices inside $S$ that are not in $S_i$. For $v \in (\bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^1) \cup (S \setminus \bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^0)$ we define $y(v) = 1$, and for $u \in \bigcup_{S_i \in Y} S_i^0$ we define $y(u) = 0 $. We demonstrate this mapping by a small example in Figure \ref{fig:target-values}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{graphics/target_values.eps}
    \caption[]{A training sample given by a graph $G$ with candidate solution $S$. Edges are omitted for the sake of clarity. The three best neighboring solutions of $S$ w.r.t. the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood structure can be obtained by applying one of the swaps $(u_1, v_1), (u_1, v_2), (u_2, v_2)$ (marked by dotted lines). Thus, the vertices $v_1, v_2$ and the vertices in $S \setminus \{u_1, u_2\}$ are labeled with 1, whereas all remaining vertices are labeled with 0. }
    \label{fig:target-values}
\end{figure}

As the target mapping $y$ maps the vertices to either 0 or 1, this method of training can be seen as a vertex level binary classification task. A vertex $v \in V \setminus S$ is labeled with 1, if there exists a vertex $u \in S$ with label 0 such that swapping $u, v$ leads to a candidate solution with improved objective value. 
In order to train the GNN therefore propose to use the binary cross entropy\footnote{More precisely, we use Flux.jl's logitbinarycrossentropy function, which is mathematically equivalent, but more numerically stable} as a loss function, which is suitable for binary classification tasks:
\[
    \mathit{binarycrossentropy}(\hat{y}, y) = \mathit{mean}(-y \cdot \log(\hat{y} + \epsilon) - (1 - y) \cdot \log(1 - \hat{y} + \epsilon))    
\]
Here, $\hat{y}$ denotes a vector of size $|V|$ that contains predictions given by the GNN, $y$ denotes the target values obtained as previously described, and $\epsilon$ denotes a small positive number that is included to avoid infinity. 

% Obtain target values: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Imitation learning: 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item first appraoch: search neighborhood $\Omega_1$ for best solution(s). vertices in these solutions have target value 1, others have target value 0
%         \item extend first approach to a larger neighborhood, e.g. $\Omega_2$ or $\Omega_3$
%         \item for small graphs: use MILP model (implement better performing formulation F3 or F4 from \cite{VeremyevPBP16})
%         \item try beam search look ahead search, which also partially searches a larger neighborhood
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Reinforcement learning:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Beam Search with fixed depth $l$ to find best neighboring solution starting from candidate solution $S$: each node of the beam search tree corresponds to a candidate solution that has a distance of $i$ swaps to initial solution, where $i$ is the level of the search tree.
%         \item expand each node of the beam search tree into successor nodes that can be obtained by performing a single swap. expand each node into $k$ children, using the $k$ most promising swaps according to the GNN. this way the GNN guides how the search space is explored
%         \item evaluate each node by performing a single iteration of the local search procedure (with a local search / tabu search that uses the GNN as a scoring function). the value of a node is determined as the best found solution by the local search procedure
%         \item on each level, keep $\beta$ most promising nodes
%         \item when maximum depth $l$ is reached, return the candidate solution(s) that have the highest value according to the local search procedure. these solutions are then used as the best neighboring solutions 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item If there is a single best neighboring solution, calculate training targets as described: 1 for vertices in best neighboring solution, 0 otherwise. As a refinement, use e.g. the 5 best neighboring solutions and calculate targets based on the objective value of each solution: e.g. 1 for nodes in the best solution, 0.8 for nodes in the second best solution, etc 
% \end{itemize}


\section{Look-Ahead Search}\label{sec:lookahead-search}
\todo{überarbeiten, hier wird weiter gemacht sobald das training mit $\Omega_1$ mit Encoder/Decoder funktioniert}

In order to obtain target values for training the GNN, we need to be able to identify the best neighboring solutions in a given neighborhood structure relative to the $S$. More specifically, we want to consider the neighborhood structure(s) $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ for different values of $d$. In this section, we propose different methods in order to search these neighborhood structures. 

\subsection{A simple approach: Searching $\Omega_1$}

As a first approach, we can define the look-ahead search as simply searching the neighborhood structure $\Omega_1$ w.r.t. a candidate solution $S$, which can be done in time $O(|V|^2)$ by inspecting all possible swaps. 
When the GNN is trained successfully to imitate this look-ahead search, it will serve the same purpose as the function $d_S$ in Chapter~\ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}. 

\subsection{Beyond $\Omega_1$}

In order to search the larger neighborhoods $\bigcup_{i=1}^d \Omega_i$ for $d > 1$, we distinguish between exact approaches, and heuristic approaches. 
As already stated in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, the neighborhood structure $\Omega_d$ can be searched in time $O(|V|^{2d})$ by enumerating all possible swaps. While this might be a viable approach for small graphs and small $d$, this method quickly becomes infeasible for larger neighborhoods and graphs. 

We present an exact MILP-approach, which can be used for small instances, and a heuristic approach, that should serve as an approximation of the best neighboring solution, as even for small $d$, the neighborhood structures are already too large to be searched exhaustively for bigger instances. 

First, we propose a MILP formulation that is suited for small instances. 
It is based on the formulation in \ref{milp-mqcp}, but we change it to find the neighboring solution $S'$ that can be obtained after at most $d$ swaps and maximizes the amount of edges in $G[S']$: 
\begin{align}
    \max & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n a_{ij} w_{ij} \\
    \text{s.t. } & \sum_{i \in V} x_i = k \\
     & \sum_{i \in S} x_i \geq k - d    
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    w_{ij} &\leq x_i, & & w_{ij} \leq x_j, & & w_{ij} \geq x_i + x_j - 1, & & j > i=1, \dots , n \\
    w_{ij} &\geq 0,   & & x_i \in \{0,1\}, & & j > i = 1, \dots, n        & & 
\end{align}

Additionally, we propose a second method that approximates the best neighboring solution, trading solution quality with efficiency in order to make training possible on larger instances. This method is based on Beam Search and its pseudocode is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:lookahead-beam-search}. We define a simple data structure for nodes in the beam search tree, where each node corresponds to a set $S'$ that can be obtained from the candidate solution $S$ by swapping the nodes in $node.in \subseteq S$ with the nodes in $node.out \subseteq V\setminus S$. Furthermore, $node.f$ denotes the objective value of a node, which is defined as the number of edges in the subgraph induced by $S'$. 
\fxnote{GR: Hier besser auch wieder $f$, $g$ und $h$ in der üblichen Bedeutung in einer heuristischen Suche verwenden, siehe BS vorne.}
In each iteration all nodes representing candidate solutions in the beam are expanded into child nodes the following way: Assume a candidate solution $S'$ corresponds to a node in the search tree. This candidate solution is then expanded into up to $\alpha^2$ candidate solutions that can be obtained by switching the $\alpha$ nodes with highest $d_{S'}$-values in $V \setminus S'$ with the nodes with the lowest $d_{S'}$ values in $S'$. All expanded nodes are then evaluated by their objective value and the best $\beta$ candidate solutions become the new beam, whereas the remaining solutions are discarded.
\fxnote{GR: Mich überrascht hier, dass in einem Schritt gleich mehrere Knoten ausgetauscht werden, wird da der Suchbaum nicht gleich extrem breit? Ok, es steht hier, dass nur die Knoten mit den höchsten $d_S$-Werten mit den Knoten mit den niedrigsten getauscht werden -- aber das definiert ja dann wiederum nur einen Nachfolger, außer es gibt Ties. Wie Ties behandelt werden müsst man hier auch erklären. 
Austäusche von Knoten, die nicht die größten/kleinsten $d_S$-Werte haben werden gar nicht versucht? Ist das nicht eine ganz erhebliche Einschränkung?
Was ist hier weiters das Abbruchkriterium? Solche Swaps können ja beliebig lange fortgesetzt werden.
Weiters ist Symmetrievermeidung/reduzierung ein wichtiger Aspekt, d.h., das States, die auf unterschiedliche Art erzeugt werden können, nicht unnötig mehrfach verfolgt werden. Z.B. Austausch x1 und x3, dann x2 und x4. Zuerst x2 und x4 tauschen, dann x1 und x3 führt zur gleichen Lösung.}

\section{GNN Architecture}\label{sec:gnn-architecture}
In this section we present the key components of the NN architecture used in our algorithm and justify our choices in designing said architecture. 
The whole process of evaluating a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a candidate solution $S$ is presented by means of a small example in Figure \ref{fig:gnn-architecture}. 
Initially, feature vectors $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are computed for all vertices in $V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, producing a feature matrix of dimension $\mathit{dim_{in}} \times |V|$, where $\mathit{dim_{in}}$ is the size of a feature vector. This feature matrix is used as input for the GNN based encoder, which consists of $l_e$ graph convolutional layers and outputs a node embedding matrix of dimension $\mathit{dim_{out}} \times |V|$. From these node embeddings, a context is computed by taking into account the current candidate solution $S$, and aggregating corresponding node embeddings by an aggregation function $\mathit{agg}$, generating a context embedding. The context embedding is concatenated to the node embeddings. The resulting matrix is used as input for the decoder, which can be realized as an MLP with a final layer $l_d$, which maps the values of the previous layer to a scalar output score by applying a sigmoid activation function. 

In the remaining Section we will discuss feature selection, the structure of the encoder and decoder, and the context embedding in detail.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/gnn-architecture.eps}

    \label{fig:gnn-architecture}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsection{Node Features}
Since the node embeddings are only computed once per graph, it is essential that the computed node features represent the vertices in a meaningful way by extracting similarities and differences of vertices and their surrounding neighborhoods. More precisely, high quality features should map vertices with similar neighborhoods closer together in the feature space, whereas vertices that are very distant from each other and do not share many neighbors should be further apart. Moreover, it is essential that the chosen feature initialization method is transferrable and generalizes well on unseen graphs, as the GNN used in our algorithm is trained offline on representative problem instances that differ from the instances encountered during execution. 

In \cite{Duong2019} the authors analyze the effect of different node feature initialization methods on node classification task. They distinguish between centrality based approaches (e.g. degree based initialization, number of triangles that a vertex participates in, etc), and learning-based approaches (e.g. DeepWalk \cite{Perozzi2014}, where vertices are mapped closer together, if the probability that they occur in a random walk together is higher). 
The authors conclude that centrality-based approaches are generally not as suitable as learning-based approaches by evaluating different feature initialization approaches in a node classification setting. While methods like DeepWalk or its generalization node2vec \cite{GroverL16} seem promising, they are not suitable for our use case, as these methods are not suitable for across-network transfer learning tasks. DeepGL \cite{Rossi17a} is a feature learning framework for graphs that addresses this issue as it was designed to learn complex relational functions on graphs that transfer for across-network learning. 

For centrality-based features, we evaluate the following feature initialization methods: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Degree initialization: Each vertex is initialized by its degree.
    \item EgoNet initialization: Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, and vertex $v \in V$, let $N(v, d)$ be the set of vertices reachable from $v$ by a path of length at most $d$. The induced subgraph $G[N(v, d)]$ is the $d$-hop-EgoNet of vertex $v$. Note that for $d=1$, $N(v, d)$ is the closed neighborhood of $v$ in $G$. We derive three features from the EgoNet of each vertex in $V$: the size $|N(v, d)|$, the number of edges in the subgraph induced by the EgoNet $|E(G[N(v, d)])|$, and the number of edges that leave $N(v, d)$, i.e. ${\{u, v\} \mid u \in N(v,d), v \notin N(v,d), \{u,v\} \in E}$.     
    \item Pagerank initialization: The computation is done as described in \cite{page1999pagerank}. Each vertex is then initialized by its pagerank.
\end{itemize}

\fxnote{Learning-based features: DeepWalk und node2vec sind nicht geeignet für across-network transfer learning tasks - Experimente mit diesen Initialisierungsmethoden waren daher erfolglos. DeepGL könnte vielversprechend sein, aber ich habe keine Implementierung gefunden - da ist es die Frage ob es den Aufwand wert ist?}

\subsection{Encoder}
In general, any graph convolutional network (GCN) model can be used as an encoder. We refer to Residual Gated Graph Convolutional Networks (\cite{Bresson2017}), and GATv2 networks (\cite{Velickovic2018}, \cite{Brody2021}), which we will use in our experiments. Based on these GCN models, we propose two architectures. In the following we denote by $dim_i$ the input dimension of layer $i, 0 \leq i \leq l_e$ of the network, where $l_e$ is the number of layers used in the encoder, $dim_0$ corresponds to the feature dimension of the node features, and for $1 \leq i \leq l_e$ $dim_i$ corresponds to the output dimension of layer $i$. 

\subsubsection{Residual Gated Graph Convolutional Encoder}
The update function of a Gated Graph Convolutional layer is defined in \cite{Bresson2017} as 
\[
    h_i^{l+1} = f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) = \text{ReLU} \Big( U^l h_i^l + \sum_{j \rightarrow i} \eta_{ij} \odot V^l h^l_j \Big),
\]
where $\eta_{ij} = \sigma(A^l h_i^l + B^l h_j^l)$. Here, $A^l, B^l, U^l, V^l$ are learnable parameter matrices and $\odot$ denotes the hadamard-product. 
Furthermore, the authors define the Residual Gated Graph Convolutional layer by adding the identity operator: 
\[
    h_i^{l+1} = f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) + h_i^l
\]
The authors suggest that residual layers should be used on successive convolutional layers. 
Furthermore, we add a batch normalization (\cite{IoffeS15}) layer after every GCN layer, which results in a final update function 

\[
    h_i^{l+1} = \text{BN} \Big( f_{\text{G-GCNN}}^l(h_i^l, \{ h_j^l \colon j \rightarrow i \}) + h_i^l \Big),
\]
where BN denotes batch normalization. 

We therefore propose a GCN model \textit{RG-GCN}, which makes use of these layers and is structured as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Layer 1: We apply a Gated Graph Convolutional layer that maps the feature vectors of dimension $dim_0$ to embeddings of dimension $dim_1$, followed by batch normalization.
    \item Layers 2, \dots, $l_e$: For layer $i, 2 \leq i \leq l_e$ we apply a Residual Gated Graph Convolutional layer, followed by batch normalization, mapping inputs of dimension $dim_{i-1}$ to dimension $dim_i$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{GATv2 Encoder}

\subsection{Context}
The context is determined by the current candidate solution $S$ and is computed by aggregating the columns of the node embedding matrix that correspond to the vertices in $S$. In general, any order invariant aggregation function $\mathit{agg} \in \{\mathit{sum, mean, max}\}$ can be used. The context is then concatenated to the node embeddings to produce inputs for the decoder. 

\subsection{Decoder}
The decoder is a regression model that maps the inputs obtained from the node embeddings and the context embedding to scalar values representing scores for the vertices in $V$. We suggest using a simple MLP architecture with a sigmoid activation function on the final layer, mapping the results of the previous layer to scalar values between zero and one. 

\section{Performance}\label{sec:performance}

Since the main difference between the algorithms presented in Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} and \ref{chp:gnn} lies in the scoring function used to evaluate vertices during the swap based local search procedure, we want to analyze the effect of using the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$ instead of the scoring function $d_S$. 
In order to do so, we identify the three main operations during the local search procedure that are influenced by the choice of scoring function: Initialization, restricting neighborhoods, and updating the scoring function.  

\subsection{Initializing the scoring function}
At the start of the local search procedure, a construction heuristic is used to produce a new candidate solution $S$, which serves as a starting point. 
The scoring function $d_S$ must then be initialized, as it is dependent on $S$. The initialization procedure can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:init-dS}.
It starts by initializing an array of zeros of size $|V|$. For each vertex $u \in S$, increase the value $d_S[v]$ by one for each neighbor $v$ of $u$. This procedure has a worst-time-complexity of $O(|V|^2)$ time, as the size of $S$ is in $O(|V|)$, and each vertex in $S$ can have $O(|V|)$ neighbors. 

\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwIn{Graph $G = (V,E)$, candidate solution $S$}
    \KwOut{Initialized scoring function $d_S$}
    $d_S \gets [0, \dots, 0]$ // Array of size $|V|$ \;
    \For{$u \in S$}{
        \For{$v \in N_G(u)$}{
            $d_S[v] \gets d_S[v] + 1$
        }
    }
    \Return{$d_S$}
    \caption{Initialize scoring function $d_S$}
    \label{alg:init-dS}
\end{algorithm}

When using the scoring function $gnn_S$, initializing the scoring function is done by computing node embeddings for each vertex in $G$. This is done by first computing node features and then computing node embeddings by passing the node features through a GNN based encoder. The time complexity of this initialization depends on the complexity of the chose node features and the structure of the GNN itself, but in general both will take $O(|V|^2)$ time on graphs that are not sparse. The argument is similar as with $d_S$, as each vertex needs to be evaluated by taking in account all its neighboring vertices. 
The advantage when using a GNN based scoring function is that this initialization process has to be done only once per graph, and not every time a new candidate solution is generated by the construction heuristic. In subsequent restarts of the local search procedure, only the linear time decoder has to be applied. 

Since initialization is only done once per graph or once per restart of the local search procedure, the runtime should not have a great impact on the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, especially with a GNN based scoring function, this time should be used by utilizing an encoder of high enough complexity to produce high quality node embeddings. 

\subsection{Restricting the neighborhood}
When using the scoring function $d_S$, the neighborhood $\Omega_1$ is searched implicitly, as only swaps that maximize the gain are considered. 
The restricted candidate sets $X \subseteq S, Y \subseteq V \setminus S$ are generated in time $O(|V|)$, as only the minimum and maximum scores for vertices in $S$ and $V \setminus S$, respectively, have to be determined. As a reminder, the restricted candidate sets are defined as 
\[
    X = \{ u \mid u \in S, d_S(u) \leq d_{\min} + 1 \}, \\
    Y = \{ v \mid v \in V \setminus S, d_S(v) \geq d_{\max} - 1 \},
\]
with $d_{\min} = \min_{u \in S} d_S(u), d_{\max} = \max_{v \in V \setminus S}$. 
If the swap $u \in S,v \in V \setminus S$ maximizes the gain of the candidate solution, this method of restricting the neighborhood guarantees that $u \in X, v \in Y$.
While this method produces restricted neighborhoods of variable size, these neighborhoods are usually small and thus can be searched efficiently in practice. In general however, the size of the sets $X, Y$ can be in $O(|V|)$ in the worst case. 

Using the scoring function $\mathit{gnn}_S$, we don't have a guarantee that the swap that maximizes the gain lies among the lowest-scoring vertices in $S$ and the highest-scoring vertices in $V \setminus S$. Moreover, we might not even want to consider such a swap, as the scoring function was trained to search greater neighborhoods than $\Omega_1$, and the swap that maximizes the gain does not lead to the best neighboring solution. We therefore propose to use a restricted candidate sets $X,Y$ of a fixed size $k$, where $X$ consists of the $k$ lowest-scoring vertices in $S$, and $Y$ consists of the $k$ highest-scoring vertices in $V \setminus S$. This guarantees that searching the neighborhood takes a fixed amount of time. 
Obtaining the $k$ highest or lowest scoring vertices can be done in time $O(k |V|)$, which is linear for fixed $k$, but is still more expensive than generating a restricted neighborhood for the scoring function $d_S$. As the restricted neighborhood is searched in every iteration of the local search procedure, its size can therefore also have a great impact on the runtime. It is therefore essential to determine a neighborhood size that strikes a good balance between efficiency and quality of neighboring solutions found in the neighborhood.  


\subsection{Updating the scoring function}
After each swap of vertices $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$ the scoring function needs to be updated, as it is dependent on the current candidate solution $S$. For $d_S$, this update can be efficiently in $O(|V|)$ time by decrementing $d_S[x]$ for $x \in N_G(u)$ and incrementing $d_S[y]$ for $y \in N_G(v)$. All other vertices remain unaffected by a single swap and their corresponding $d_S$-values do not need to be updated. 

For the scoring function $gnn_S$, we can generally not update the scores incrementally, as the context embedding changes, which is part of the input of all vertices. Therefore, all vertices need to be re-evaluated by the decoder. This still takes time linear in the number of vertices, but, depending on the complexity of the decoder, it can take considerably more time than updating $d_S$ after a swap. As this operation is done in every iteration of the local search procedure, it has a great impact on the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, the complexity of the decoder should be chosen such that it is as small and efficient as possible while still providing high quality predictions. 

\subsection{Conclusion}
When analyzing the performance aspect of the proposed scoring functions, it seems clear that a GNN based scoring function can in practice not be as fast and efficient as $d_S$. However, we hope to overcome this drawback by keeping the NN - especially the decoder - as small and efficient as possible, by determining a neighborhood size that balances efficiency and solution quality, and by training the NN to provide a better guidance through the search space than $d_S$, leading to solutions of improved quality. 

% \section{First Approach}
% This subsection documents the first attempts at testing GNN structures and different methods of training; it will be removed or reworked later.

% \paragraph{Collecting Training Data.} We start by trying an imitation learning approach on smaller graphs. Especially the following graphs in Table \ref{tab:first-approach} from the DIMACS benchmark set seem to have an appropriate size for a first approach. 
% These graphs can be grouped into three categories: two low density graphs ($0 < \mathit{dens}(G) \leq 0.2$), three medium density graphs ($0.4 \leq \mathit{dens}(G) \leq 0.6$), and five high density graphs ($0.75 \leq \mathit{dens}(G)$). 

% As already discussed, a training sample consists of a graph $G = (V, E)$ and a candidate solution $S \subset V$. 
% As a first step, we collect a dataset of training samples from executing the metaheuristic local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}. Training samples are collected the following way: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Generate a random graph with a number of vertices sampled from a normal distribution with $\mu = 200, \sigma = 15$ - this ensures the size of the graph will be around 200 vertices
%     \item Generate uniformly sampled random edges, with uniformly sampled density depending on graph category: 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item low density: $dens(G) \in (0, 0.2)$
%         \item medium density: $dens(G) \in [0.4, 0.6]$
%         \item high density: $dens(G) \in [0.75, 0.9]$
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Run the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm} for 60 seconds and record all encountered candidate solutions. From all encountered candidate solutions, sample 100 to add to the dataset. 
% \end{itemize}
% This way, we collect $10,000$ training samples for each of the three categories: We generate 100 different graphs for each category, and collect 100 samples for each graph. 

% \paragraph{Training the GNN.} As a first approach, we try to imitate existing local search algorithms, which try to identify the best neighbor in the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood structure: Given a training sample $(G, S)$, where $G$ is a graph instance and $S \subset V$ a candidate solution, we first obtain the best neighboring solution $S^\prime \in \Omega_1$, which is defined as the best candidate solution (= with higher objective value, which is density for the MQCP) that can be obtained by swapping a single pair of vertices $u \in S, v \in V \setminus S$. If there are multiple best neighboring solutions with equal objective value, ties are broken randomly. From this we can compute the target values for training the following way: For each vertex $v \in V$, we define the target value as $1$ if $u \in S^\prime$, and $0$ if $v \notin S^\prime$. 

% \paragraph{GNN Architecture.} We start with a simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). For each vertex $v \in V = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we define a feature vector 
% $x_v = 
% \begin{bmatrix} deg(v) \\
%     d_S(v) 
% \end{bmatrix}$. 
% As a first approach, we simply use three Graph Convolutional Layers. As output, we obtain a scalar value for each input vector, which is the score of the vertex evaluated by the GNN. 

% \paragraph{Evaluating the approach.} 
% In principle, we can view training the network as a binary classification task for each vertex $v \in V$: The GNN should predict for each vertex, whether it is in the best neighboring solution $S^\prime$ or not. 
% In order to evaluate the effectivity of this training, we therefore propose the following: We do a $80/20$ training/validation split of the $10,000$ samples and train the network on $80\%$ of the data. Then, we evaluate each sample in the validation set the following way: The GNN is used to calculate the scores for vertices in the sample, and a swap is performed according to the scores returned by the GNN. If the resulting candidate solution has the same objective value as the (one of the) best solution(s) returned by exhaustively searching the $\Omega_1$ neighborhood, then the GNN has correctly identified the best neighboring solution, otherwise, the result is incorrect. As a first step, we will look how accurately the GNN identifies the (one of the) best neighboring solution(s). 

% Finally, if the accuracy of this approach reaches satisfactory results, we can try evaluating the approach on the benchmark instances, and compare the results to i) the local search algorithm from Chapter \ref{chp:local-search-algorithm}, and ii) the results from the literature.
