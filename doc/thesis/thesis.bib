	abstract = {Given a graph and a threshold (c), the maximum quasi-clique (MQC) problem is to ﬁnd a maximum cardinality subset of vertices in the graph such that the edge density of a corresponding induced subgraph is not less than c. This problem istended version of the famous maximum clique problem, which arises in a various application domains and is known as NP-hard. In this study, we propose a heuristic method called the hybrid artiﬁcial bee colony (HABC) algorithm to address the MQC problem by incorporating several dedicated strategies into the artiﬁcial bee colony framework, which starts with an opposition-based initialization phase and then repeatedly alternates between an employed bees phase, an onlooker bees phase and a scout bees phase to perform the search. The employed bees phase and onlooker bees phase employ a decent local search and solution-based tabu search to locate the local optima and intensify the search,whereas the scout bees phase employs an opposition-based mechanism to reconstruct the best-found solutions to escape from the local optima and diversify the search. Experimental results indicate that our proposed HABC algorithm can improve the best-known solutions for 46 out of 112 problem instances and match the best-known solutions for 63 instances. Comparisons with the state-of-theart heuristics and exact methods demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm.},

This problem is NP-hard and has a number of applications in data mining, for example, in social networks or phone call graphs. In this work, we present an exact algorithm to solve this problem, based on a quasi-hereditary property. We also propose a new upper bound that is used for pruning the search tree. Numerical results show that the new approach is competitive and outperforms the best integer programming approaches in the literature.

Recent heuristic MQCP algorithms can hardly solve large and hard graphs effectively. This paper develops an efﬁcient local search algorithm named NuQClq for the MQCP, which has two main ideas. First, we propose a novel vertex selection strategy, which utilizes cumulative saturation information to be a selection criterion when the candidate vertices have equal values on the primary scoring function. Second, a variant of conﬁguration checking named BoundedCC is designed by setting an upper bound for the threshold of forbidding strength. When the threshold value of vertex exceeds the upper bound, we reset its threshold value to increase the diversity of search process. Experiments on a broad range of classic benchmarks and sparse instances show that NuQClq signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MQCP algorithms for most instances.},

The maximum γ -clique problem consists in finding a γ -clique of largest cardinality in the graph. Despite numerous practical applications, this problem has not been rigorously studied from the mathematical perspective, and no exact solution methods have been proposed in the literature. This paper, for the first time, establishes some fundamental properties of the maximum γ -clique problem, including the NP-completeness of its decision version for any fixed γ satisfying 0 {\textless} γ {\textless} 1, the quasi-heredity property, and analytical upper bounds on the size of a maximum γ -clique. Moreover, mathematical programming formulations of the problem are proposed and results of preliminary numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art optimization solver to find exact solutions are presented.},

Given a graph G, the maximum γ -quasi-clique problem (γ -QCP) consists of finding an induced γ -quasi-clique with the maximum number of vertices. γ -QCP generalizes the wellknown maximum clique problem and its solution is useful for detecting dense subgraphs. After reviewing known integer linear programming formulations and dual bounds for γ -QCP, a new formulation obtained by decomposing star inequalities and combining edge inequalities is proposed. The model has an exponential number of variables but a linear number of constraints and its linear relaxation allows the computation by column generation of dual bounds for large and dense graphs. The connectivity of γ -quasi-cliques is also discussed and a new sufficient connectivity condition presented. An extensive computational experience shows the quality of the computed dual bounds and their performance in a branch-and-price framework, as well as the practical effectiveness of the connectivity condition.},

abstract="To effectively solve challenging staff rerostering problems, we propose to enhance a large neighborhood search (LNS) with a machine learning guided destroy operator. This operator uses a conditional generative model to identify variables that are promising to select and combines this with the use of a special sampling strategy to make the actual selection. Our model is based on a graph neural network (GNN) and takes a problem-specific graph representation as input. Imitation learning is applied to mimic a time-expensive approach that solves a mixed-integer program (MIP) for finding an optimal destroy set in each iteration. An additional GNN is employed to predict a suitable temperature for the destroy set sampling process. The repair operator is realized by solving a MIP. Our learning LNS outperforms directly solving a MIP with Gurobi and yields improvements compared to a well-performing LNS with a manually designed destroy operator, also when generalizing to schedules with various numbers of employees.",

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input.

This paper analyzes the elementary clique-defining properties implicitly exploited in the available clique relaxation models and proposes a taxonomic framework that not only allows to classify the existing models in a systematic fashion, but also yields new clique relaxations of potential practical interest. Some basic structural properties of several of the considered models are identified that may facilitate the choice of methods for solving the corresponding optimization problems. In addition, bounds describing the cohesiveness properties of different clique relaxation structures are established, and practical implications of choosing one model over another are discussed.},

While this function is usually developed manually for a specific problem, we propose a more general Learning Beam Search (LBS) that uses a machine learning model for guidance. Learning is performed by utilizing principles of reinforcement learning: LBS generates training data on its own by performing nested BS calls on many representative randomly created problem instances. The general approach is tested on two specific problems, the longest common subsequence problem and the constrained variant thereof. Results on established sets of benchmark instances indicate that the BS with models trained via LBS is highly competitive. On many instances new so far best solutions could be obtained, making the approach a new state-of-the-art method for these problems and documenting the high potential of this general framework.",

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing research interest in integrating machine learning techniques into meta-heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This integration aims to lead meta-heuristics toward an efficient, effective, and robust search and improve their performance in terms of solution quality, convergence rate, and robustness. Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.}

The proposed article includes an introduction to the underlying biochemistry and genomic aspects of the problems as well as to the graph-theoretic aspects of the solution approaches. Each subsequent section describes a particular type of problem, gives an example to show how the graph model can be derived, summarizes recent progress, and discusses challenges associated with solving the associated graph-theoretic models. Clique-detection models include prescribing (a) a maximal clique, (b) a maximum clique, (c) a maximum weighted clique, or (d) all maximal cliques in a graph. The particular types of biochemistry and genomics problems that can be represented by a clique-detection model include integration of genome mapping data, nonoverlapping local alignments, matching and comparing molecular structures, and protein docking.}

Prominent examples of such hereditary structures are cliques and some clique relaxations intensively discussed and studied in network analysis. The effectiveness of the tailored RDS by Trukhanov et al. for s-plex and s-defective clique can be attributed to their cleverly designed incremental verification procedures used to distinguish feasible from infeasible structures. In this paper, we clarify the incompletely presented verification procedure for s-plex and present a new and simpler incremental verification procedure for s-defective cliques with a better worst-case runtime. Furthermore, we develop an incremental verification for s-bundle, giving rise to the first exact algorithm for solving the maximum cardinality and maximum weight s-bundle problems.}

We construct new extractors which require only log n + O(1) additional random bits for sources with constant entropy rate. We further construct dispersers, which are similar to one-sided extractors, which use an arbitrarily small constant times log n additional random bits for sources with constant entropy rate. Our extractors and dispersers output 1-α fraction of the randomness, for any α>0.We use our dispersers to derandomize results of Hastad [23] and Feige-Kilian [19] and show that for all ε>0, approximating MAX CLIQUE and CHROMATIC NUMBER to within n1-ε are NP-hard. We also derandomize the results of Khot [29] and show that for some γ > 0, no quasi-polynomial time algorithm approximates MAX CLIQUE or CHROMATIC NUMBER to within n/2(log n)1-γ, unless NP = P.Our constructions rely on recent results in additive number theory and extractors by Bourgain-Katz-Tao [11], Barak-Impagliazzo-Wigderson [5], Barak-Kindler-Shaltiel-Sudakov-Wigderson [6], and Raz [36]. We also simplify and slightly strengthen key theorems in the second and third of these papers, and strengthen a related theorem by Bourgain [10].},

  abstract={In social network analysis (SNA), relationships between members of a network are encoded in an undirected graph where vertices represent the members of the network and edges indicate the existence of a relationship. One important task in SNA is community detection, that is, clustering the members into communities such that relatively few edges are in the cutsets but relatively many are internal edges. The clustering is intended to reveal hidden or reproduce known features of the network, while the structure of communities is arbitrary. We propose decomposing a graph into the minimum number of relaxed cliques as a new method for community detection especially conceived for cases in which the internal structure of the community is important. Cliques, that is, subgraphs with pairwise connected vertices, can model perfectly cohesive communities, but often they are overly restrictive because many real communities form dense but not complete subgraphs. Therefore, different variants of relaxed cliques have been de?ned in terms of vertex degree and distance, edge density, and connectivity. They allow to impose application-speci?c constraints a community has to ful?ll such as familiarity and reachability among members and robustness of the communities. Standard compact formulations fail in ?nding optimal solutions even for small instances of such decomposition problems. Hence, we develop exact algorithms based on Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation and branch-and-price techniques. Extensive computational results demonstrate the e?ectiveness of all components of the algorithms and the validity of our approach when applied to social network instances from the literature.},
