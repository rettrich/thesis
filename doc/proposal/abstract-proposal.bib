	abstract = {Given a graph and a threshold (c), the maximum quasi-clique (MQC) problem is to ﬁnd a maximum cardinality subset of vertices in the graph such that the edge density of a corresponding induced subgraph is not less than c. This problem istended version of the famous maximum clique problem, which arises in a various application domains and is known as NP-hard. In this study, we propose a heuristic method called the hybrid artiﬁcial bee colony (HABC) algorithm to address the MQC problem by incorporating several dedicated strategies into the artiﬁcial bee colony framework, which starts with an opposition-based initialization phase and then repeatedly alternates between an employed bees phase, an onlooker bees phase and a scout bees phase to perform the search. The employed bees phase and onlooker bees phase employ a decent local search and solution-based tabu search to locate the local optima and intensify the search,whereas the scout bees phase employs an opposition-based mechanism to reconstruct the best-found solutions to escape from the local optima and diversify the search. Experimental results indicate that our proposed HABC algorithm can improve the best-known solutions for 46 out of 112 problem instances and match the best-known solutions for 63 instances. Comparisons with the state-of-theart heuristics and exact methods demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithm.},

This problem is NP-hard and has a number of applications in data mining, for example, in social networks or phone call graphs. In this work, we present an exact algorithm to solve this problem, based on a quasi-hereditary property. We also propose a new upper bound that is used for pruning the search tree. Numerical results show that the new approach is competitive and outperforms the best integer programming approaches in the literature.

Recent heuristic MQCP algorithms can hardly solve large and hard graphs effectively. This paper develops an efﬁcient local search algorithm named NuQClq for the MQCP, which has two main ideas. First, we propose a novel vertex selection strategy, which utilizes cumulative saturation information to be a selection criterion when the candidate vertices have equal values on the primary scoring function. Second, a variant of conﬁguration checking named BoundedCC is designed by setting an upper bound for the threshold of forbidding strength. When the threshold value of vertex exceeds the upper bound, we reset its threshold value to increase the diversity of search process. Experiments on a broad range of classic benchmarks and sparse instances show that NuQClq signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MQCP algorithms for most instances.},

The maximum γ -clique problem consists in finding a γ -clique of largest cardinality in the graph. Despite numerous practical applications, this problem has not been rigorously studied from the mathematical perspective, and no exact solution methods have been proposed in the literature. This paper, for the first time, establishes some fundamental properties of the maximum γ -clique problem, including the NP-completeness of its decision version for any fixed γ satisfying 0 {\textless} γ {\textless} 1, the quasi-heredity property, and analytical upper bounds on the size of a maximum γ -clique. Moreover, mathematical programming formulations of the problem are proposed and results of preliminary numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art optimization solver to find exact solutions are presented.},

Given a graph G, the maximum γ -quasi-clique problem (γ -QCP) consists of finding an induced γ -quasi-clique with the maximum number of vertices. γ -QCP generalizes the wellknown maximum clique problem and its solution is useful for detecting dense subgraphs. After reviewing known integer linear programming formulations and dual bounds for γ -QCP, a new formulation obtained by decomposing star inequalities and combining edge inequalities is proposed. The model has an exponential number of variables but a linear number of constraints and its linear relaxation allows the computation by column generation of dual bounds for large and dense graphs. The connectivity of γ -quasi-cliques is also discussed and a new sufficient connectivity condition presented. An extensive computational experience shows the quality of the computed dual bounds and their performance in a branch-and-price framework, as well as the practical effectiveness of the connectivity condition.},

abstract="To effectively solve challenging staff rerostering problems, we propose to enhance a large neighborhood search (LNS) with a machine learning guided destroy operator. This operator uses a conditional generative model to identify variables that are promising to select and combines this with the use of a special sampling strategy to make the actual selection. Our model is based on a graph neural network (GNN) and takes a problem-specific graph representation as input. Imitation learning is applied to mimic a time-expensive approach that solves a mixed-integer program (MIP) for finding an optimal destroy set in each iteration. An additional GNN is employed to predict a suitable temperature for the destroy set sampling process. The repair operator is realized by solving a MIP. Our learning LNS outperforms directly solving a MIP with Gurobi and yields improvements compared to a well-performing LNS with a manually designed destroy operator, also when generalizing to schedules with various numbers of employees.",

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input.

This paper analyzes the elementary clique-defining properties implicitly exploited in the available clique relaxation models and proposes a taxonomic framework that not only allows to classify the existing models in a systematic fashion, but also yields new clique relaxations of potential practical interest. Some basic structural properties of several of the considered models are identified that may facilitate the choice of methods for solving the corresponding optimization problems. In addition, bounds describing the cohesiveness properties of different clique relaxation structures are established, and practical implications of choosing one model over another are discussed.},

abstract="Beam search (BS) is a well-known incomplete breadth-first-search variant frequently used to find heuristic solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems. Its key ingredient is a guidance heuristic that estimates the expected length (cost) to complete a partial solution. While this function is usually developed manually for a specific problem, we propose a more general Learning Beam Search (LBS) that uses a machine learning model for guidance. Learning is performed by utilizing principles of reinforcement learning: LBS generates training data on its own by performing nested BS calls on many representative randomly created problem instances. The general approach is tested on two specific problems, the longest common subsequence problem and the constrained variant thereof. Results on established sets of benchmark instances indicate that the BS with models trained via LBS is highly competitive. On many instances new so far best solutions could be obtained, making the approach a new state-of-the-art method for these problems and documenting the high potential of this general framework.",

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing research interest in integrating machine learning techniques into meta-heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This integration aims to lead meta-heuristics toward an efficient, effective, and robust search and improve their performance in terms of solution quality, convergence rate, and robustness. Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.}
